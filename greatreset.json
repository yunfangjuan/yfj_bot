JPM\u2019s deposits were declining quarter over quarter in 2022 but went back up in Q1, perhaps due to the banking crisis. Deposits went from $2.56 trillion in Q1 2022 and $2.34 trillion in Q4 2022 to $2.37 trillion in Q1 2023. Their payment business also grew significantly. The payment revenue grew 26% YoY, from $1.9B in Q1 2022 to $2.4B in Q1 2023. \nOverall, it was a good quarter for JP Morgan Chase. But since the banking crisis happened in mid-March, the full effect was probably not reflected in their financials yet. My mother-in-law just told me she got a 5-month CD from Chase at 4%. This tells us how much things have changed since the banking crisis that even Chase is paying a decent interest on our deposits, which is quite a shocker. We will see if their net interest margin shrinks in the coming quarters. One thing we can be sure of is that free deposits are over for banks.\u00a0 Things are going to get more difficult for them as banks deal with the long-duration assets held on their books while having to pay significant interest on customer deposits.\u00a0"}, {"title": "4/13/2023: Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade is Complete", "post_id": "114634263.4132023-ethereum-shanghai-upgrade", "subtitle": "2 weeks' wait to un-stake ETH ", "content": "The Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade is complete!

The median bid price on the Hiive marketplace was 41.9% of the last primary round\u2019s valuation in March 2023 vs. 55.6% in December 2022. The median asking price was 66.8% of the last round\u2019s valuation in March 2023 vs. 74.1% in December 2022. Given that many companies that IPOed in 2020-2021 lost 60+% of their value, the further correction on pre-IPO share prices made sense. The market activity did surge with the lowered price. In the report, Hiive Market CEO said this represents a new normal where buyers and sellers are coming to terms with the new lower prices. The order volume increased but the price remains sluggish. \nIf we look at individual companies, many companies saw significant price declines from December 2022 to March 2023. DataBricks went from $128-$146 in Dec 2022 to $37-$43 in March 2023. Discord went from $285-$383 to $243-$262. Flexport went from $10.35-$10.45 to $9-$9.47. At the same time, Rippling and Prove Identity are holding strong with prices slightly up. \nI am not surprised that more pre-IPO shareholders are selling their shares in marketplaces like Hiive. Liquidity is drying up and the IPO market is still quite frozen. If a significant percentage of my net worth were locked in a private company, I would probably try to liquidate some of my holdings right now to have peace of mind. But if the private market valuations go down further, I will probably spend some time to see if there are any good opportunities to invest. Pessimism is positively correlated with investment returns.

", "post_id": "113357004.4102023-is-6-month-ai-pause-a-reasonable", "subtitle": "Nope", "content": " \nA couple of weeks ago, the Future of Life Institute published an open letter calling for AI labs to \"immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4.\" My first reaction was that The AI ship has sailed. No one can stop it. This letter also came across as authoritarian and patronizing. Who is there to decide who gets to develop LLM models and who doesn't? It was also not clear what can be done during the 6-months pause to make AI development safe and what is the criteria to resume AI development after six months? \nAI is a very powerful technology. But humanity has had great inventions like AI before i.e. electrical grid, cars, internet, etc. We didn\u2019t stop the development of cars because people can die in car accidents and horse carriages would be obsolete by cars. In the same vein, while we recognize there could be some risks, we cannot deny the huge benefits of AI. At the moment, AI can already boost white collar workers\u2019 productivity significantly, make education more accessible and help improve health care outcomes. With the continued R&D, it could become even more powerful and beneficial to humanity. We shall find a path to harness the power of AI instead of being afraid of it. \nAI heavyweights Andrew Ng and Yann LeCun had a conversation about the AI pause last Friday as shown in the Youtube video above. Like me, they think the pause is a bad idea. Both of them think that AI R&D should continue as the benefits will be huge. But we should work on how AI products could be regulated to minimize the chance of misuse and damage. They also mentioned that while GPT-4 is impressive, it\u2019s still pretty far away from AGI. Yann doesn\u2019t think the autoregressive LLMs can really get us to AGI so it\u2019s realistically still 30-50 years away. They also think the pause is not implementable and if governments pass laws to stop AI development, it will be devastating as AI could really advance humanity. They also expect a democratization/democratization of large LLMs. Namely, there will be many companies and organizations beyond OpenAI to make large LLMs accessible and more competition will help advance the space. The whole conversation was very informative. Please watch the youtube video above if you are concerned about AI being too powerful. Personally I am not too worried about it (yet). People don\u2019t realize how much of the human intelligence is not represented in languages or images and AI still needs to figure out how to pick that up. \u00a0\u00a0 \n "}, {"title": "4/7/2023: March Jobs Report Remains Strong", "post_id": "113341816.472023-march-jobs-report-remains", "subtitle": "236K jobs added", "content": "The March jobs report is out. 236K jobs were added in March vs. 230K expected.

She duped the bank into believing Frank had more than 4M customers. In reality, the startup had fewer than 300K. She allegedly paid a data science professor $18K to fabricate the customer list and paid ASL Marketing another $105k for a dataset of 4.5m students. The criminal charges include conspiracy, wire fraud affecting a financial institution and bank fraud, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison if Javice is convicted. She was also charged with securities fraud, which has a 20-year maximum. \nWOW! This is terrifying. By all means people can blame investors\u2019 poor due diligence work.

In this case, she was arguing that she couldn\u2019t just hand over the customer datasets due to privacy and competitive reasons.

He talks about various thing in the letter but what really caught my eye is the following: \nHigher fiscal spending, higher debt to gross domestic product (GDP), higher investment spend in general (including climate spending), higher energy costs and the inflationary effect of trade adjustments all lead me to believe that we may have gone from a savings glut to scarce capital and may be headed to higher inflation and higher interest rates than in the immediate past. \nEssentially, we may be moving, as I read somewhere, from a virtuous cycle to a vicious cycle. \nJamie Dimon is basically telling us that inflation will be high for a while and the Fed will keep the interest rates high as a result. Apparently, many investors are expecting rate cuts this year. But I think I will trust Jamie Dimon on this one. \nRegarding the SVB blowup, he has the following comment: \nRegarding the current disruption in the U.S. banking system, most of the risks were hiding in plain sight. Interest rate exposure, the fair value of held-to-maturity (HTM) portfolios and the amount of SVB\u2019s uninsured deposits were always known \u2013 both to regulators and the marketplace. The unknown risk was that SVB\u2019s over 35,000 corporate clients \u2013 and activity within them \u2013 were controlled by a small number of venture capital companies and moved their deposits in lockstep. It is unlikely that any recent change in regulatory requirements would have made a difference in what followed. Instead, the recent rapid rise of interest rates placed heightened focus on the potential for rapid deterioration of the fair value of HTM portfolios and, in this case, the lack of stickiness of certain uninsured deposits. \nAfter the SVB crisis, many tech people suddenly become macroeconomists and blame the Fed for being clueless. Well, I actually think the Fed knows what they are doing but they don\u2019t have other better options. The prolonged period of QE and ZIRP eventually led to inflation. They realized they made a big mistake to let the ZIRP/QE party last too long. They had to raise rates to fix the situation. They were well aware of the consequences. Some banks were going to fail and they did. But the Fed gotta do what they need to do to bring the interest rates and the Fed balance sheet to a more reasonable place. Look, our top monetary officials all studied macroeconomics and financial history and are old enough to experience the previous big inflation cycle in the 1970s. Many banks also failed during that time. Do people really think they are clueless? They knew what would happen and they will deal with it when s**t hits the fan but their priority is always to keep the inflation under control and the unemployment rate low. Some tech investors need to stop thinking they are the only people who have the clues. They already got their SVB deposits bailed out.

I am very very bullish on OpenAI and I believe it will be a company that creates multi-trillion dollars of value. Its ownership structure is a bit complicated as it was structured as a capped-profit company. Namely, if it does generate trillions of dollars of profits, most of the profits will be shared with the public. It\u2019s yet to be seen how this will play out but I appreciate OpenAI\u2019s intention. (I have zero financial interest in OpenAI except I will be a recipient of the shared wealth as a member of the public.) I hope OpenAI will be the next Vanguard, whose member owned business model turns out to be the best non-profit/capped-profit I have ever encountered. OpenAI has a fairly small team with ~300(?) people but the people I know who work there are mission driven people. It feels a bit like the early days of Facebook and I am so excited with what they will build in the coming decades. \nAs an early stage investor, I have also been thinking about how to invest in AI in the current landscape. I am not too keen on startups who try to build large models like GPT-4. Even if they have the right talent, it will be very expensive to do that. But I think there are areas where startups can leverage GPT-4 to make killer applications. Two areas I am particularly interested in are: \nProprietary Datasets: companies that possess proprietary datasets and expertise can align the GPT-4 to particular objectives. It appears that GPT-4 uses similar ideas described in this InstructGPT paper to optimize for particular goals. I believe OpenAI also offers its enterprise clients a custom reward model and a custom reinforcement learning policy. Companies can load in their specialized datasets and train models for powerful specialized applications. For example, a specialty model that can summarize, highlight important information and raise red flags from SEC filings and in turn measure risks of public companies effectively. In fact, I have invested in a company that does that exactly that: Bedrock AI \nAction Loop: OpenAI recently launched the ChatGPT plugins that can trigger actions directly. There are many applications for these. For example, someone can build an AWS bot to do DevOps work that we all hate to do. I can ask the AWS bot to set up a Lambda function on AWS. The bot will write the function and test it with a few examples. Once the code is bug free, it then launches it on AWS. If it encounters any IAM permission errors or has other dependencies, it will figure out the right permissions or setup, ask you to approve and make it work on the spot. There are tons of opportunities in this area and ChatGPT plugins are basically AppStore for the 2020s. I am so excited about it. \nIf you are a startup founder and you are working on the above, please DM me. I would love to chat more and see if there\u2019s any way to collaborate through investments or/and mentorship.\u00a0 \n"}, {"title": "3/31/2023: PCE Went up 0.3% in February ", "post_id": "111870665.3312023-pce-was-03-in-february", "subtitle": "YoY PCE 5% , YoY Core PCE 4.6% ", "content": " \nThe February PCE report was out this morning.

It\u2019s worth a read but here are some excerpts from the complaint: \nDefendants have disregarded applicable federal laws while fostering Binance\u2019s U.S. customer base because it has been profitable for them to do so. For example, according to Binance\u2019s own documents for the month of August 2020 the platform earned $63 million in fees from derivatives transactions and approximately 16% of its accounts were held by customers Binance identified as being located in the United States. By May 2021, Binance\u2019s monthly revenue earned from derivatives transactions increased to $1.14 billion. Binance\u2019s decision to prioritize commercial success over compliance with U.S. law has been, as Lim paraphrased Zhao\u2019s position on the matter, a \u201cbiz decision.\u201d \nInternally, Binance officers, employees, and agents have acknowledged that the Binance platform has facilitated potentially illegal activities. For example, in February 2019, after receiving information \u201cregarding HAMAS transactions\u201d on Binance, Lim (their chief compliance officer at the time) explained to a colleague that terrorists usually send \u201csmall sums\u201d as \u201clarge sums constitute money laundering.\u201d Lim\u2019s colleague replied: \u201ccan barely buy an AK47 with 600 bucks.\u201d And with regard to certain Binance customers, including customers from Russia, Lim acknowledged in a February 2020 chat: \u201cLike come on. They are here for crime.\u201d Binance\u2019s MLRO agreed that \u201cwe see the bad, but we close 2 eyes.\u201d \nIn or around October 2020, Binance underwent a compliance audit to satisfy a request from Paxos. But according to Lim, Binance purposely engaged a compliance auditor that would \u201cjust do a half assed individual sub audit on geo[fencing]\u201d to \u201cbuy us more time.\u201d As part of this audit, the Binance employee who held the title of Money Laundering Reporting Officer (\u201cMLRO\u201d) lamented that she \u201cneed[ed] to write a fake annual MLRO report to Binance board of directors wtf.\u201d Lim, who was aware that Binance did not have a board of directors, nevertheless assured her, \u201cyea its fine I can get mgmt. to sign\u201d off on the fake report. Around the same time as the referenced \u201chalf assed\u201d compliance audit, in November 2020 the MLRO exclaimed to Lim in a chat, \u201cI HAZ NO CONFIDENCE IN OUR GEOFENCING.\u201d \nIn addition to the entities that operate the Binance platform, Zhao is the direct or indirect owner of entities that have engaged in proprietary trading activity on the Binance platform, including Merit Peak Limited and Sigma Chain AG, and Zhao is also the direct or indirect owner of approximately 300 separate Binance accounts that have engaged in proprietary trading activity on the Binance trading platform. (Basically, CZ/Binance are trading against its customers.) \nI don\u2019t know how CFTC got all the chat logs and internal documents but Binance looks bad. At the same time, I am not surprised. Binance has always been a pretty shady organization. They probably don\u2019t want to be fully compliant because the derivative business is so profitable for them and their offering like perpetual contracts are illegal in the USA. I can give them the benefit of doubt for the derivative trading stuff but the money laundering stuff is super shady and can get them into big big trouble. I believe the US government is trying to break up with the crypto world after Luna and FTX. (Who can blame them?) But it appears there\u2019s a very strong dark force to support shady organizations like Binance because criminals want to find a way to move money around and public blockchains are not really that anonymous any more.

It is truly high quality and understands my intent a lot better. I have been doing a lot of ETL/Analytics work on blockchain data and ChatGPT-4 has been immensely helpful. I asked ChatGPT to convert my MySQL schema into RedShift Schema and to write a PySpark script (with a sample given by me) on AWS Glue. It finished all the work in seconds and the scripts just worked. I ETLed 3 tables from MySQL to RedShift in ~10 minutes. This used to be a two hour slog including a lot of copy and paste. I am a lot more productive because of the tools. \nNext, I was trying out a new dashboard-ing tool called Retool. Their documentation was not very good. I asked ChatGPT to teach me how to do specific things on Retool and I was able to set up something pretty quickly. I thought it would take me hours to get familiar with Retool but again it took me only minutes. \nMy general feeling is that GPT-4 understands my intent a lot better than GPT-3 and in turn produces much better results. Some people said it\u2019s (almost) AGI. Honestly, I don\u2019t care. But my understanding is that GPT-4 is an LLM supercharged with state-of-the-art Reinforcement Learning (from Human Feedback). I don\u2019t know if this setup is enough to get us to AGI but I do know this technology will make white collar workers a lot more productive. As a result of that, we might not need so many people to work on white collar jobs. If we only need 20% of the white collar workers to produce 500% of the current output, how do we redistribute the wealth? Obviously, most of the increased productivity is generated by the AI, not the humans who operate AI. \nAnother worry I have is that this technology will make people stupid. I spent all these years learning various programming languages, system architecture, DevOps and data science to have a lot of context in software development. I am sure this applies to most other white collar professions too. But for young generations who don\u2019t have to go through the learning to get tasks done, I wonder if people will use their brain less. It\u2019s quite likely AI will be way smarter and way more productive than most if not all human beings and it\u2019s unclear how useful intellect will be in the AI-ruled world . Maybe I am just overthinking it. Under the new world order, arrogant intellectuals will become irrelevant.

Can they do this without using taxpayers\u2019 money? That remains to be seen. \nThere\u2019s an ongoing investigation about SVB\u2019s debacle. The Fed published a prepared testimony by Michael S. Barr, Vice Chair for Supervision. Mr Barr called SVB a textbook case of mismanagement. The most striking part of the testimony is that regulators knew SVB was badly managed but they were not able to get SVB to fix all the glaring issues. It sounded like the SVB management ignored regulators\u2019 advice and the regulators in charge were not empowered to force the necessary changes. Here is the part that shows how SVB management ignored the regulators: \nThe picture that has emerged thus far shows SVB had inadequate risk management and internal controls that struggled to keep pace with the growth of the bank. In 2021, as the bank grew rapidly in size, the bank moved into the large and foreign banking organization, or LFBO, portfolio to reflect its larger risk profile and was assigned a new team of supervisors. LFBO firms between $100 billion and $250 billion are subject to some enhanced prudential standards but not at the level of larger banks or global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). \nNear the end of 2021, supervisors found deficiencies in the bank's liquidity risk management, resulting in six supervisory findings related to the bank's liquidity stress testing, contingency funding, and liquidity risk management.4 In May 2022, supervisors issued three findings related to ineffective board oversight, risk management weaknesses, and the bank's internal audit function. In the summer of 2022, supervisors lowered the bank's management rating to \"fair\" and rated the bank's enterprise-wide governance and controls as \"deficient-1.\" These ratings mean that the bank was not \"well managed\" and was subject to growth restrictions under section 4(m) of the Bank Holding Company Act.5 In October 2022, supervisors met with the bank's senior management to express concern with the bank's interest rate risk profile and in November 2022, supervisors delivered a supervisory finding on interest rate risk management to the bank. \nIn mid-February 2023, staff presented to the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors on the impact of rising interest rates on some banks' financial condition and staff's approach to address issues at banks. Staff discussed the issues broadly, and highlighted SVB's interest rate and liquidity risk in particular. Staff relayed that they were actively engaged with SVB but, as it turned out, the full extent of the bank's vulnerability was not apparent until the unexpected bank run on March 9. \nBasically, SVB management fucked up big time. It didn\u2019t matter how much service SVB provided to the tech and startup ecosystem. SVB was a bank and they didn\u2019t even get the basics right. Regulators warned them repeatedly but they did nothing until it was too late. It\u2019s either incompetence or hubris or both. By looking at how SVB managed itself, it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s really just a matter of time before the management blows the bank up. It happened to occur two weeks ago. But if it didn\u2019t happen then, it will surely happen sometime in the future.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n"}, {"title": "3/24/2023: More Distress Ahead", "post_id": "110488238.3242023-more-distress-ahead", "subtitle": "Someone has to eat the loss", "content": " \nI watched the PBS documentary Age of Easy Money (as shown above) last night. Nothing in the doc surprised me but it was a really good summary of what happened since 2008 and what will be facing in the coming years. The tl;dr is that the US economy and financial system is in big trouble but we can\u2019t keep kicking the can down the road. Now is the time to take the bitter medicine and to hit the reset button. It\u2019s going to create a lot of chaos and wipe out many businesses and individuals. But if we don\u2019t take this opportunity to clean things up, the damage will keep compounding and will eventually explode. \nSo what exactly does the age of easy money get us into? The zero interest rate policy (ZIRP) made money cheap to borrow and quantitative easing flooded our financial system with money supply. Money became cheap and easy to borrow. But cheap money makes everything else expensive, i.e.: stocks, art, real estate. People borrowed money at low interest rates and loaded up on all kinds of assets. Real assets and securities became unsustainably expensive and businesses and individuals were feeling rich while sitting on a lot of debt. Then inflation hit. The Fed realized their easy money policy was pushing up prices and they needed to start tightening to bring down the inflation. Money becomes expensive and hard to borrow. Asset prices started to deflate but the debt amount didn't shrink. On the contrary, businesses and individuals need to pay higher interest to service their debt. The Fed fund rates went from 0-0.25% to 4.75-5% in the past year. People with variable rate debt are probably scrambling to handle the increased interest expenses.\u00a0 \n \n \nIn addition, valuation of fixed income investments is sensitive to interest rates. If you buy a 10-year treasury note that pays 2% per annum exactly a year ago at $100 and now a newly issued 10-year treasury note pays 3.5% per annum, you can\u2019t sell your treasury note today at $100. You need to offer a discount to compensate for the lower coupon rate. Assuming the 9-year term interest rate is also 3.5%, if you sell your note today, you will only get $88.5 (=PV(1.75%, 18, 1, 100) in Google Sheet). The longer the duration, the deeper the discount is. The 30-year mortgage rate went from 3% to 6% in a year. I just did a calculation in Google sheet. Whoever held the 30-year mortgage debt issued last year is sitting on a ~30% loss right now. According to Bloomberg, 40+% of outstanding mortgages originated in 2020 and 2021. Whoever held those mortgages is ~30% underwater. There\u2019s ~$12 trillion dollars worth of household mortgage debt in the US at the end of 2022. $12T * 40% * 30% ~=$1.4T. In other words, there\u2019s $1+ trillion dollars of unrealized loss on just household mortgages. Someone has to eat that loss as the home owners are not going to pre-pay their mortgages with <3% interest rates. Who is someone? Retail investors, banks, pension funds, college endowments, public institutions and finally the Fed (aka taxpayers) are most likely the bag holders who take the big hit. \nAll this mess is created by the unsustainable zero interest rate policy. Because of it, we are going to see instability in our financial systems as asset prices collapse and the paper wealth gets destroyed. An even bigger issue here is that this paper wealth didn\u2019t actually do much. A house doesn\u2019t actually increase in actual utility when the price doubles. Same for stocks or a piece of artwork. People felt richer but it was all an illusion. Financial growth is not equal to real economic growth. As the ZIRP era comes to the end, we have a lot to reflect on. Perhaps we should focus on putting money into building things that will generate real wealth for people in the long run such as affordable housing, AGI, semiconductor manufacturing or nuclear power plants, instead of this fake money game driven by the Fed and amplified by over leveraged and over financialized institutions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"title": "3/23/2023: Hindenburg Research is Shorting Block", "post_id": "110254355.3232023-hindenburg-research-is-shorting", "subtitle": "Many tech companies are facing similar issues", "content": " \nShort seller Hindenburg Research published a scathing report about Block, formerly known as Square. I read through the report. No, Block did not blatantly commit financial frauds or cook the book. (Sigh of relief!) But the report blasted Block\u2019s poor compliance of the CashApp that enables criminals and an unprofitable business model. Well, this sounds like a pretty common problem for high growth tech companies, doesn\u2019t it? The truth is that there is almost always a tradeoff between growth and proper compliance, especially for Fintech companies. If you ask users to go through the proper KYC/AML process, you will be compliant but the added friction will cause a lot of customers to churn during on-boarding. The customer acquisition cost could become too high to make your business viable. But if you let customers sign up without proper KYC/AML, your app will inevitably invite fraudulent and criminal actors and eventually you will get into all kinds of trouble with regulators. Balancing between growth and proper compliance is an intricate form of art. Hindenburg also said in the report that Block understated its customer acquisition costs. Poor compliance plus high customer acquisition costs sounds like a recipe for disaster. \nI have a very mixed feeling about this report. On the one hand, I don\u2019t think the problems Hindenburg pointed out are unique to Block. Many tech companies have similar compliance and profitable growth challenges and the hope is that over time, things could be improved. But on the other hand, Block has been around for a long time and the company has a $36B market cap, they should have had their act together by now. I don\u2019t have any frame of reference to know how bad their KYC/AML compliance is but Block is losing a lot of money on the GAAP basis and is facing a lot of competition. It\u2019s unclear what\u2019s going to happen after this report but we can be sure that investors\u2019 appetite for unprofitable growth and regulatory risks is waning in today\u2019s environment and companies need to adjust to this new reality.\u00a0"}, {"title": "3/22/2023: Fed Raised Rates by 0.25%", "post_id": "110087414.3222023-fed-raised-rates-by-025", "subtitle": "Fed Fund Rates are now 4.75 - 5%", "content": " \nAs expected, the Fed raised rates by 0.25% after the March FOMC meeting.

The upcoming recession and the subsequent small rate hikes will definitely help though. \nIn addition to the rate hike announcement, FOMC also published economic projections by the FOMC members. The median projections for the EOY fed fund rates for 2023, 2024 and 2025 are 5.1%. 4.3% and 3.1% respectively.

It\u2019s truly embarrassing how these attention-seeking cryto talking heads behave. All the evidence we have so far indicates a mild crisis, not an apocalypse. The unrealized losses banks have right now are a lot smaller compared to 2008 as shown below. SVB, First Republic and Signature Banks are in trouble because they have a flighty deposit base, hold long term debt and are not stress tested. But they are the exceptions, not the norm. Most smaller banks have a much stickier deposit base. They can navigate the duration mismatch a lot more easily.\u00a0 Large banks are regularly stress tested and are unlikely to fail.\u00a0 \nCredit Suisse was rescued over the weekend. CS has been in trouble for the longest time and is basically a zombie bank. Remember Archegos blowup? CS lost $5.5B in that one scandal.

In my opinion, it\u2019s a bad idea for people to put a large percentage of their net worth into something they have no control of and pray that its cryptography will never be broken or can be easily upgraded.  I asked ChatGPT to write a story about how BTC could plunge to zero due to weak cryptography. The story below makes a lot of sense.  \nIn the year 2031, the world was abuzz with the advancements in quantum computing. These powerful machines, capable of solving complex problems at unprecedented speeds, had disrupted every industry. Scientists, mathematicians, and cryptographers all marvelled at the incredible potential of this cutting-edge technology. But they were also well aware of the Pandora's box that had been opened. \nOne of the most significant applications of this technology was in cryptography, which formed the backbone of the world's financial systems. No system was as reliant on cryptography as Bitcoin, the original and still the most valuable cryptocurrency. With a price of one million dollars per coin, Bitcoin had made many people unimaginably wealthy, and the market capitalization of the cryptocurrency had swelled to multiple trillions of dollars. \nWhales, as the biggest Bitcoin investors were known, held vast fortunes in their digital wallets. They believed their assets to be secure, protected by the robust cryptographic algorithms that had been unbreakable for more than a decade. Little did they know that the security they had taken for granted was about to be shattered. \nIn a small, nondescript laboratory, an ambitious team of cryptographers and quantum computing experts had been working tirelessly on a secret project. They were attempting to crack Bitcoin's cryptographic algorithms using quantum computers, driven by the prospect of unimaginable wealth and a place in history. \nAfter months of feverish work, the team made a breakthrough. They discovered a method to derive private keys from their corresponding public keys, effectively breaking the cryptographic signature scheme that protected the wallets of the Bitcoin whales. As soon as they realized the magnitude of their discovery, the team quickly put their plan into action. \nAlmost overnight, the unthinkable happened. The private keys of many of the biggest Bitcoin whales were exposed, and their wallets were systematically plundered. Billions of dollars' worth of Bitcoin was transferred to random wallets, vanishing into the depths of the blockchain. \nAs the news of the breach spread like wildfire, panic gripped the Bitcoin market. The price plummeted from its lofty heights of one million dollars to zero, effectively erasing trillions of dollars in value. The once-unstoppable juggernaut of the cryptocurrency world had come to a grinding halt. \nThe fallout was swift and brutal. Governments around the world scrambled to regulate and control the technology that had brought the world's premier cryptocurrency to its knees. Investigations were launched, and the race was on to find the perpetrators of the Great Quantum Heist. \nThe team behind the heist had anticipated the backlash and had taken measures to cover their tracks. They knew that they had changed the course of history, and they watched from the shadows as the world reacted to their handiwork. As the dust settled, they knew that they had become legends in the annals of cybercrime. \nThe collapse of Bitcoin sent shockwaves through the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. Trust in digital assets was shattered, and countless fortunes were vaporized overnight. As the world attempted to pick up the pieces, one thing became abundantly clear: the age of quantum computing had irrevocably changed the landscape of cryptography, finance, and cybersecurity. \nIn the aftermath of the Great Quantum Heist, new cryptographic algorithms emerged, designed to be resistant to the threats posed by quantum computing.

The banking crisis continues, and it feels like the world is ending. Personally, I feel that people are overreacting and let me present you the most outrageous tweet I've seen all week, as shown above. Prominent tech/crypto investor Balaji Srinivasan predicts that BTC will hit $1M in 90 days due to hyperinflation, and he is betting $1M  $2M of his own money on this event happening. I found this claim absurd and I think people in Silicon Valley need to chill and stop making outrageous claims. But I could be wrong. Laugh at me if Balaji turns out to be correct in 90 days. \nI asked ChatGPT to write a story about how the banking crisis could cause hyperinflation and lead to BTC's value rising to $1M. Here is the result, after some editing to reflect current events:  \nOnce upon a time, there was a country called America, known for its robust banking system with many banks operating within its borders. However, the banks had stopped managing interest-rate risk carefully after a prolonged period of a zero-interest-rate environment. \nAs the pandemic hit in 2020, there was a significant labor shortage, and inflation started to creep up. The central bank started hiking rates, and many banks became insolvent because the long-duration fixed-income assets on their balance sheet lost a lot of value. The government, fearing a collapse of the banking system, stepped in and bailed out the banks using taxpayer money. \nHowever, this only served to delay the inevitable. The banks held many 3% 30-year mortgage loans and 2% 20-year treasuries, leading to deep losses. The government could no longer keep bailing them out, and the banks began to fail one by one, leading to a full-blown banking crisis. \nAs people lost confidence in the banking system, they began to withdraw their money and hoard cash, causing a shortage of cash in the economy and leading to rapidly rising prices. In desperation, the government began to print more and more money, leading to hyperinflation. \nMeanwhile, many people began looking for alternative stores of value and turned to Bitcoin. As more and more people bought Bitcoin, its value skyrocketed, reaching $1 million per coin. \nThe government, seeing the success of Bitcoin, decided to embrace it and began to use it as an official currency alongside the hyperinflated national currency. This helped to stabilize the economy and restore confidence in the financial system. \nHowever, it was a hard lesson for America. The country had to rebuild its banking system from scratch, which took many years to recover fully. In the end, the crisis taught the country the importance of responsible financial management and the need to diversify its economy to avoid relying too heavily on any one industry. \nHonestly, the story doesn\u2019t make sense. The US dollar is the reserver currency of the world and that\u2019s not changing any time soon so hyperinflation is unlikely to happen and if the government doesn\u2019t want people to hoard cash, they can raise the FDIC insured limit.   \nUpdate 3/19/2023:  \nBalaji tweeted more crazy stuff and my current conclusion is that this guy is simply despicable. \nIt's normal for banks to be mark-to-market insolvent but good banks manage liquidity, credit risks and duration risks well. \nShouting that people should pull their deposits out of banks is either ignorant or malicious. 99% of Americans don't have $250K+ in one bank's accounts. Most corporates have strong treasury management that utilize money market funds, short term treasuries and etc. \nAsking people to convert their money to $BTC because sky is falling. He is obviously biased and is pumping his bag \nUSA is not going to have a hyper inflation any time soon (with 50% MoM CPI increase.) USA has its own energy and food supplies and it doesn't have a lot of war debt. Long term we have some issues but I don't think it will happen in the next 3 months. \nThis explains why normal people can't stand crypto bros. \nPlease just stop. $BTC is not going $1M."}, {"title": "3/16/2023: QE is Back Accidentally ", "post_id": "108904453.3162023-qe-is-back-accidentally", "subtitle": "$300B added to Fed's Balance Sheet ", "content": " \nThe Fed added $300B on their balance sheet in the past week in the wake of the SVB debacle, undoing four months of quantitative tightening.

The two banks that failed last week borrowed another $142.8 billion. In total, ~$300B was added to the Fed\u2019s balance sheet. \nIn other words, $300B of cash is being\u00a0 injected into our economy to help stabilize the US banking system.\u00a0 Technically that\u2019s quantitative easing. But I assume the liquidity will flow to regional banks to meet depositors\u2019 withdrawal requests.

Basically, what we were seeing was not a crypto pump but instead a stablecoin (USDC/BUSD) dump. \nAfter the SEN and SIGNET shuttered as part of the Silvergate/Signature Bank closures, it made the crypto-fiat ramp a lot more complicated and slower.

After all, normal people don\u2019t put $250K+ into their checking accounts. Even if their banks are insolvent on a mark to market basis, they won't withdraw their money because their deposits are covered by the FDIC insurance. Only a small number of banks have a high percentage of uninsured deposits and badly managed their interest rate risks like SVB. There won\u2019t be a widespread banking crisis and the Fed already gave banks a sweet program to borrow the devalued long-term assets at par. IMO, all the work the Fed put in for the banks is to ensure they can keep raising interest rates to clamp down the inflation without bankrupting too many banks. In other words, I believe it\u2019s very unlikely that the Fed pause will happen next week and I hope the yield of treasury bills will go back to 5.X% so I can buy more.

The SVB implosion affected a significant percentage of tech people and many of us also bank with First Republic Bank, which has a similar high uninsured deposits and mark to market insolvent issue. I was not affected as my fund pulled out the money successfully on Thursday and I only bank with JP Morgan Chase outside SVB but the stress level is very high and some of my portfolio companies were affected. Thankfully, the Fed did a last minute backstop to make all SVB depositors whole and came up with a program to help banks with large unrealized losses. I believe it was the right thing to do as the recovery rate would have been pretty high for SVB depositors anyway, why escalate the situation? Escalating the situation would have made things super chaotic and chances are FDIC will have to close another handful of banks this week if they didn\u2019t make SVB depositors whole. The Fed did the right thing.\u00a0 \nDespite the backstop, stocks of many vulnerable regional banks nosedived today. During today\u2019s trading sessions, First Republic Bank FRC 0.00 was down 61%, Western Alliance WAL 0.00 was down 47%, Pacwest Bankcorp PACW 0.00 was down 21%,. It was a total s**tshow. I can\u2019t imagine what would have happened if the Fed didn\u2019t backstop SVB depositors. \nThe very interesting thing from the joint statement was that Signature Bank was shut down by regulators. Signature has $110B of assets and $79.5B of which are uninsured deposits according to its FFIEC call report. It only has $8B of equity and has $40B commercial loans, $33B mortgage and $7B held-to-maturity securities. I think those $79.5B flighty deposits can easily bankrupt them if there\u2019s a bank run as they most likely also have a lot of mark-to-market losses. It is not surprising that Signature Bank was closed by the regulators. Regulators don\u2019t like crypto anyway and shutting Signature Bank down after Silvergate practically debanks crypto since\u00a0 the real-time settlement network by these two banks SEN and Signet are no longer available. Network participants will have to use ACH or Wire to transact and it will takes days instead of minutes/seconds to settle. It will be interesting to see what the long term impact is but it\u2019s clear that crypto is not welcome in America. \n \nSomeone asked if I shorted any of the obvious problematic banks. After looking at SVB and FRB\u2019s balance sheets on Thursday, I knew they were in big trouble. But as mentioned before, I never short, never buy with margin and don\u2019t get easily involved. Philosophically, I think being fair and negative is OK but being biased and negative is not OK. If I short something, I am basically biased for a very bad outcome. I might make a lot of money but that thrill and dopamine hit will only make me want to be more negative to score more wins. There\u2019s a place for the short sellers to make the market more fair and efficient. But I think I am negative enough. Being more negative will make me a very annoying person.\u00a0 I want to focus on the goodness of humanity and make money in a positive way.\u00a0"}, {"title": "3/10/2023: Government Should Guarantee at Least 90% of Uninsured SVB Deposits ", "post_id": "107687614.3102023-government-should-guarantee", "subtitle": "SVB failed ", "content": "The Silicon Valley Bank situation  quickly deteriorated and now the bank is shut down by the regulators. The bank is closed today and will reopen next Monday. Account holders with <$250K deposits with SVB will be able to withdraw the full amount next Monday. For accounts that have more than $250K+ of deposits, they will get the $250K and an \"advanced dividend\u201d plus a receivership certificate. It\u2019s unclear if they will get their full deposit back. I would have never thought that SVB could go down so quickly.\u00a0It\u2019s tragic.  \nApparently, SVB has $150B of uninsured deposits. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea for the Fed to hang these uninsured depositors out to dry. Many startups who bank with SVB might be forced to shut down or lay off people if nothing is being done over the weekend. If we look at SVB\u2019s balance sheet at the end of 2022 closely, they had $212B of assets and $195B of liabilities. If we mark down their held-to-maturity portfolio by 20%, their equity holders will be wiped out. But they should still have enough to pay back their $174B (I supposed $24B is insured) of deposits in full at the expense of the corporate bond holders and other subordinate debt holders. Even if the bank turns out to be insolvent, I still think the government should at least pay out 90% of the $150B uninsured deposits next Monday and the rest can be paid out if there\u2019s any residual value left after the assets are sold off. From SVB\u2019s financials, it looks like they can easily recoup $135B (90% of $150B) from their $212B assets. If the government doesn\u2019t do anything about the $150B uninsured deposits over the weekend, this thing can quickly snowball and have many downstream effects. $150B is a pretty big number for the bank clients to absorb. Something needs to be done and I can\u2019t think of any reason why the Fed won\u2019t step in for this situation.\u00a0"}, {"title": "3/9/2023: Silicon Valley Bank is Having a Bank Run", "post_id": "107505335.392023-silicon-valley-bank-is-having", "subtitle": "$SIVB tanked 60% today ", "content": "Silicon Valley Bank is having a bank run after announcing that they are raising $1.25B of equity to shore up their balance sheet, \u00a0after selling $21B of securities at a $1.8B loss this quarter.  After the news is out, people start to pull deposits out of the bank. FDIC only guarantees up to $250K of deposits. AFAIK, most VC funds keep more than that in their bank accounts, including my angel fund. I am pulling the money out. It\u2019s still processing.\u00a0 I hope there won\u2019t be any issues. \nIf we dig deeper, we will realize that SVB has a very similar problem to Silvergate bank. As shown in the above tweets, after dramatically growing their deposits in 2021, they invested the deposits into 10+ year mortgage backed securities, earning a whopping ~1.6% yield. Now, the short term interest rate is 5+% and customers are pulling deposits out of the bank. It\u2019s a very very tough situation. They could probably borrow at 5% from FHLB to meet withdrawal requests but they have to absorb that 3.X% gap. With $91B(?) of these securities on their balance sheet, we are talking about ~$3B a year in interest expenses or ~$30B over the next 10 years. SVB only had $16.3B of equity at the end of 2022. After the announced $1.8B loss and this annual interest expense, I don\u2019t know if they can really make it. The rate could also potentially go up to like 6% and their situation will get even worse. I don\u2019t know why on earth SVB decided that purchasing long-term debt without hedging at such a low yield is a good idea. \nI do think Silvergate Bank and Silicon Valley Bank are probably not the only banks that are in this situation. I suspect there are probably quite a few banks that made similar asset purchase decisions when rates were zero and with the rapid rise of interest rates, they are currently in deep deep trouble.\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"title": "3/8/2023: The Ultimate Startup Motivation Book ", "post_id": "107131216.382023-the-ultimate-startup-motivation", "subtitle": "Wisdom that stands the test of time", "content": "Today is a slow news day so I decided to make a book recommendation instead. \nI have read a number of startup motivation books.

I can appreciate.  \nSome people might find some of the content culturally inappropriate but since these letters were not meant to be shared publicly, it only makes these letters more authentic. As a struggling entrepreneur, I appreciate Mr. Rockefeller\u2019s insights of life and business so much. Here are a few passages that deeply resonate with me (I paraphrase the quotes a bit from my memory) : \nMany people focus on what they don\u2019t have but people should instead focus on what they do have to succeed. Life is hard and most of the time people don\u2019t have all the elements to make it work. People who achieve their goals maximize what they have to compensate for things they don\u2019t have. \nMost businesses fail not because of the mistakes founders make. They fail because of the lack of dedication from the founders. \nMoney is not the root of all evil. Loving money is the root of all evil. Money is a tool to make people\u2019s lives better. Money for money\u2019s sake is dangerous. \nA lot of people try to eat healthy and avoid junk food. That\u2019s great. But it\u2019s even more important to nurture our mind with clean spiritual thoughts and avoid junk thoughts as our mind determines our choices and actions. Good mind results in good choices and actions. Junk mind results in junk choices and actions.  \nI am merely scratching the surface here. There are 38 amazing letters!! These letters help lift my spirits and re-energize me to keep grinding.  I am so grateful that these letters are published.

Chances are the Fed knows they need to hike the rates higher but they want to communicate it in a gentle way.

In the FOMC announcement next week, they are going to publish the survey for rate expectations in addition to a new rate increase. It\u2019s going to be a nerve wrecking moment for all investors.

Interestingly, the majority of the $4B they are raising is not being used for growth but for paying RSU tax bills for its early employees. It turns out that some of the early employees\u2019 RSUs are expiring but Stripe is not ready to IPO under the current environment. This is a really expensive way to make this work though. I imagine many investors will be reluctant to put in all this money just for the IRS. At the same time, I don\u2019t think Stripe has many other options. Stripe is probably going to do great in the long run so hopefully it\u2019s worth it. On the other hand, Foursquare, a former hot tech startup, reportedly concluded that it couldn't do anything for former employees whose RSUs are set to expire. \nI asked ChatGPT how employers can address the issues of expiring RSUs. Here is its answer: \nQ: If a company doesn't IPO before the RSU expiration date, what can they do to avoid making the RSUs worthless? \nA: If a company does not go public before the RSU expiration date, there are several options they can consider to avoid making the RSUs become worthless: \nExtend the expiration date: The company can choose to extend the expiration date of the RSUs, giving employees more time to exercise their options. This may require approval from the company's board of directors and may be subject to certain restrictions. \nOffer a cash payout: The company can offer to buy back the RSUs at their current fair market value, even if the company has not gone public. This can provide employees with some value for their RSUs, even if they cannot be exercised as stock options. \nConvert the RSUs into other equity: The company may offer to convert the RSUs into other forms of equity, such as preferred stock or membership units. This can allow employees to still receive some form of equity in the company, even if it does not go public. \nNegotiate with employees: The company may be able to negotiate with employees to find a mutually agreeable solution, such as offering additional compensation or benefits in lieu of the RSUs. \nIt is important for the company to communicate clearly with employees and work to find a solution that is fair and equitable for all parties involved. \nI suspect that Stripe is doing 3 above and has to help their employees pay the IRS as part of the conversion process. I don\u2019t think this is a preferred way to address the employee RSU expiration though. Companies should just go IPO and let the market set the prices.\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"title": "3/3/2023: Silvergate Bank is in Deep Deep Trouble ", "post_id": "106304614.332023-silvergate-bank-is-in-deep", "subtitle": "Game over, Silvergate. ", "content": " \nIn a SEC filing two days ago, Silvergate Capital, the parent company behind Silvergate Bank said they have to delay filing of their annual report and they might not be able to continue as a going concern. \nAs far as I know, Silvergate is one of the only two banks that work as crypto to fiat ramps in the United States. (The other being Signature bank.) But since the great crypto meltdown in 2022, things have been rocky and they are in a very dire situation. Matt Levine had a great writeup on how Silvergate spiraled into the current situation. It\u2019s a pretty complicated story but let me try to summarize below: \nSilvergate worked with many crypto exchanges and crypto investors as shown above. At the end of Q3 2022, they had $13.2 billion of crypto deposits, out of which, $12B of the deposits are non-interest bearing. \nAt the end of Q4 2022 after the FTX/Alameda collapse, the crypto noninterest bearing deposits went down to $3.9B due to investors withdrawing money from crypto exchanges. Silvergate effectively had a bankrun and needed $8B to meet the withdrawal requests. \nSilvergate was forced to sell assets (i.e. treasuries) at a loss to meet withdrawal requests. They had a net loss of $1.5B in Q4 2022. \nTheir shareholder equity went from $1.3B to $571.8M due to the losses. \nIts regulatory leverage ratio was ~5.1% at the end of Q4 2022 due to the lower shareholder equity . \nThe regulatory requirement of the leverage ratio is 5%. If they lose another $20M, they might be below that 5% threshold and they could be forced into a receivership. Frankly, with the rate Silvergate is losing money, they could easily become insolvent.  \nIn the meantime, investors are pulling deposits out of Silvergate due to the leverage ratio and insolvency concerns, which makes things worse.  Coinbase and Circle cut ties with Silvergate after the SEC filing. \nWOW! What a mess! At this point, I think Silvergate is done. Signature Bank is still standing but it probably doesn\u2019t take much for them to decide that the crypto-to-fiat business is not worth it. If no regulated US banks would work with crypto institutions, what will happen to crypto? Is crypto still worth it if people cannot convert their crypto tokens to actual dollars?  Hopefully, we will get some answers to these important questions in the next few months.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \nUpdate:3//8/2023: Silvergate Bank is shutting down\u2026 as expected.

The Forbes article is paywalled but this Coindesk article has a pretty good recap. The tl;dr of this story is that Binance abused its privilege and moved money out of the bridge contract that was supposed to back the coin reserves on the BNB chain. The money was sent to wallets owned by crypto hedged funds including Alameda Research who later collapsed.\u00a0 \nWell, Binance\u2019s shady behavior was pretty consistent. As previously reported, Binance was caught air minting Binance-pegged BUSD on the BNB chain without actual reserve of BUSD on the ethereum chain. This time they get caught transferring reserves out of the bridge contract on the ethereum chain without burning the tokens on the BNB chain. Binance is either incompetent or complacent!!

At the same time, we're planning our business cautiously in the near term to ensure we remain agile and responsive to the current operating environment. We're pleased that we entered the year in a very healthy inventory position, reflecting our conservative approach in discretionary categories and our commitment to reliability in our frequency businesses.

We are still in a high inflation environment. The real GDP might contract but the nominal GDP will most likely grow. In fact, the higher the inflation rate, the higher the nominal GDP growth we are likely to see. For retailers like Target, they are selling mostly everyday essentials and less expensive discretionary items. People might buy less items due to the inflation. But they end up spending more money also due to the inflation. I believe this could happen to many companies who can raise prices. Namely, despite having a recession ( two quarters of negative real GDP growth), companies are still growing their revenue and earnings by raising prices. In other words, we might end up seeing many companies experience good earnings growth in a recession in the coming year!!!

This is the type of major life/financial decision people should be thoughtful of and they shouldn\u2019t treat a home buying/selling decision like booking a flight or hailing a ride. A lot of money is involved, a life trajectory is being changed and a mistake can be costly. \nOpendoor\u2019s business model is also vulnerable during a housing downturn. I don\u2019t know how well it would work during a housing boom as sellers can easily sell their homes. But during a housing bust, they can easily become a bag holder and with leverage, they can lose a lot of money really fast. The current high interest rate environment also erodes their margins as the short-term borrowing cost went from <1% to 5+% in a year. In summary, Opendoor is a product of the zero-interest rate era.  Unless Opendoor can fix its business model, I have doubts of them surviving this downturn. Holding inventory on their balance sheet was a luxury of the zero-interest era.

In the shareholder letter, AirBnB also highlighted that guests increasingly returned to cities and crossed borders post pandemic. But guests continued to stay longer on Airbnb. Gross nights booked in Q4 2022 for more than a week are 40% higher than Q4 2019. Supply on Airbnb grew by over 900,000 active listings. Average daily rates (ADR) decreased by 1% YoY to $153 in Q4 due to currency exchange. On a constant currency basis, ADR increased 5% YoY. I suppose the demand and supply is fairly well balanced despite a 16% supply increase YoY. \nOverall, it was a great quarter for AirBnB. Unlike many other high-growth tech companies, AirBnB didn\u2019t overhire during the pandemic. Compared to 2019, their headcount was down 5% while revenue was up 75%. Kudos to AirBnB for navigating through the difficult pandemic period and coming out stronger than ever.\u00a0"}, {"title": "2/16/2023: US Could Default in July", "post_id": "103379285.2162023-us-could-default-in-july", "subtitle": "if debt limit is not raised ", "content": "According to the estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the debt ceiling could be breached between July and September this year if the congress doesn\u2019t vote to increase the debt ceiling. We haven\u2019t seen this movie before. Let us ask ChatGPT what will happen if the debt ceiling is actually breached.  \nQ: What happens if the US debt ceiling is breached? \nA: The US debt ceiling is a legal limit on the amount of debt that the US government can issue to pay for its obligations. If the debt ceiling is breached, it means that the government cannot issue any more debt to cover its expenses. This can lead to a number of serious consequences for the US economy and financial system. \nIf the debt ceiling is breached, the US government may not be able to pay its bills, including payments for Social Security, Medicare, and other entitlement programs. It may also be unable to pay interest on its existing debt or redeem its bonds as they come due. This could lead to a default on US government debt, which would have serious implications for the US financial system and the global economy. \nA default on US government debt would likely cause a significant increase in interest rates, as investors demand higher returns to compensate for the increased risk of holding US debt. This could lead to a sharp drop in the value of the US dollar and a rise in inflation. It could also cause a loss of confidence in the US government's ability to manage its finances, which could lead to a broader economic crisis. \nTo avoid breaching the debt ceiling, the US government has a few options, such as cutting spending, increasing taxes, or raising the debt ceiling. In the past, the debt ceiling has been raised through bipartisan agreements in Congress, but there have also been instances of political brinkmanship and gridlock that have resulted in near misses on the debt ceiling. The consequences of breaching the debt ceiling could be severe, so it is important for the US government to take action to address the issue before it becomes a crisis. \nQ: Has the debt ceiling ever been breached before? \nA: The United States has never technically defaulted on its debt, but there have been instances when the debt ceiling has been breached in the past, causing disruptions in financial markets and leading to uncertainty about the government's ability to meet its financial obligations. \nThe most recent instance of the debt ceiling being breached occurred in August 2011, when the government came within days of exceeding the debt limit. This led to a downgrade of the US government's credit rating by Standard & Poor's, a major credit rating agency. The potential for a default on US government debt led to increased volatility in financial markets, as investors worried about the consequences of a default. The crisis was ultimately resolved when Congress passed the Budget Control Act of 2011, which included provisions to raise the debt ceiling and implement spending cuts. \nThere have been several other instances in the past when the government has come close to breaching the debt ceiling, including in 2013 and 2015. In each case, Congress eventually raised the debt ceiling to avoid defaulting on US government debt. \nThe debt ceiling is a recurring issue in US politics, and debates over the debt ceiling and government spending can be contentious and divisive. However, defaulting on US government debt would have serious consequences for the US economy and financial system, and it is generally seen as a scenario to be avoided at all costs. \nIn the short-term,  the US debt ceiling needs to be raised but this cannot continue forever. Look at the UK. GBP gradually lost its reserve currency status in the past century and the UK central bank is now very limited on what they can do because if they keep issuing new debt like crazy, GBP will devalue and they can descend into a third world country. America should think about our future generations and stop spending the money we don\u2019t have so fast.  The deficit spending we currently have is not sustainable in the long run.  \n"}, {"title": "2/15/2023: BUSD is being Canceled", "post_id": "103171047.2152023-busd-is-being-canceled", "subtitle": "No more new BUSD can be minted. ", "content": " \nStablecoin BUSD (Binance USD) is being canceled. According to the above press release, effective February 21, Paxos will cease issuance of new BUSD tokens as directed by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). Paxos will continue to manage BUSD dollar reserves. In other words, Paxos can no longer issue new BUSDs but existing BUSDs can be redeemed and the supplies of BUSD can only decrease over time. \nPaxos seems legit and fully compliant and that\u2019s why Binance worked with them to gain legitimacy of their stablecoins. But there's definitely some shenanigans happening on the Binance side. About a month ago, Bloomberg published an article about BUSD being under collateralized on the BNB chain. What happened was that BUSD was fully backed and compliant on the Ethereum chain. But on the BNB chain, there\u2019s this thing called Binance-pegged BUSD which was backed by the BUSD stored in the bridge contract on Ethereum. They are supposedly to be backed 1-to-1. But apparently, the BUSD balances on Ethereum were lower than the total Binance-pegged BUSD circulation on the BNB chain at times. If all the Binance-pegged BUSDs were bridged over from BNB to Ethereum, the bridge contract will run out of BUSDs. This was super shady. Guess who has the authority to mint Binance-pegged BUSD on the BNB Chain? Binance that is. Guess where people actually use BUSD stablecoins? BNB chain that is. It turns out users are not using BUSDs but Binance-pegged BUSDs. If they are fully backed 1-to-1 at all times, that would not be an issue.\u00a0 This is actually how it works for many tokens across chains such as USDC between Ethereum and Avalanche and USDC between Ethereum and Polygon. I suppose most users assume this is also how it works for BUSD between Ethereum and BNB but users have been duped.\u00a0 \nIf I were NYDFS, I would be super pissed. This is a scheme to use Paxos as a front to issue legitimate 1-to-1 backed stablecoins on Ethereum and then mint Binance-pegged BUSD that is fractional reserved on a different chain. \nFurthermore, BUSD stablecoins had an outstanding circulation of ~16B. 16B is already pretty high. If the circulation grows another 10X, it will start to be a pretty big headache for regulators to manage. It could become too big to fail. I am not surprised that BUSD got banned but I am disgusted by how shady Binance is by confusing users with the pegged version of BUSD stablecoins.\u00a0"}, {"title": "2/14/2023: January CPI was 6.4% ", "post_id": "102945210.2142023-january-cpi-was-64", "subtitle": "It didn't go down as fast as people thought", "content": " \nJanuary CPI report is out.

It seems in general people are more receptive to price increases so businesses raise prices more aggressively to counter their increasing costs. If every business does that multiple times, this becomes a classic price increase spiral in economics and I am not sure if the price increases are slowing down for essential goods and services.

Everyone is focusing on cost cutting and profitability right now and I believe this is a good thing. For any business to sustain, they have to grow responsibly and be profitable. The way the streaming giants competed with one another by throwing money around was not sustainable. They will be more profitable when they pull back on the production budget. Consumers will have less shows to watch but honestly I don\u2019t believe consumers will really feel the difference.

But capitalism is brutal. Large platforms like Twitter need to make money to sustain their operations. So far, digital advertising generates way more revenue and is a much better business model than subscriptions.

In the post, he said the following I found very interesting: \nBefore getting into our product priorities, I want to discuss my management theme for 2023, which is the \"year of efficiency\". We closed last year with some difficult layoffs and restructuring some teams. When we did this, I said clearly that this was the beginning of our focus on efficiency and not the end. Since then, we've taken some additional steps like working with our infrastructure team on how to deliver our roadmap while spending less on capex. Next, we're working on flattening our org structure and removing some layers of middle management to make decisions faster, as well as deploying AI tools to help our engineers be more productive. As part of this, we're going to be more proactive about cutting projects that aren't performing or may no longer be as crucial, but my main focus is on increasing the efficiency of how we execute our top priorities. \nI am glad Zuck acknowledged that Meta has an efficiency problem.\u00a0 What I heard\u00a0 through my Facebook network is that Meta\u2019s organizational issue is beyond the deep layers of org structure. There seems to be a lot of bloat in general so removing layers of managers and turning them into individual contributors or asking them to leave seems to be a good start. But I believe they also need to have a culture of value creation, which AFAIK has not been practiced ever since the company became big and successful. What is the culture of value creation? I am a startup entrepreneur so I do this a lot. Basically, I would like the productivity-to-team-size to remain constant or higher as the team grows . If I hire someone and after a couple of months, that person doesn\u2019t increase the overall output for whatever reasons, then that person will be let go. Sometimes it\u2019s not even that person\u2019s fault.\u00a0 I can hire a rockstar but if I don\u2019t have the right setup for the rockstar to perform due to timing or context, they\u00a0 may not be able to create sufficient value for the company. \u00a0Anyhow, every person has to be a net value creator. Namely, the value created by this person far exceeds their compensation. I know I sound like slave driving Elon Musk but if you want efficiency and a high performing team, that\u2019s what you gotta do. I don\u2019t think this value assessment is easy to do at very large organizations like Meta though. Plus, for large organizations, innovations usually require experimentation and a little bit of inefficiency to take hold. But it can go unwieldy if it\u2019s not done in a controlled and disciplined fashion. For Meta, it appears the org problem is easy to diagnose but very very hard to solve. \u00a0 I am looking forward to seeing how Meta executes their year of efficiency at scale and still has focus and discipline on their area of innovations.\u00a0"}, {"title": "1/31/2023: Snap Missed Q4 Revenue Estimates ", "post_id": "100130072.1312023-snap-missed-q4-revenue-estimates", "subtitle": "Stock tanked after hours", "content": "Snap reported Q4 2022 earnings after market close today.

It looks more like a symptom of a deeper issue. Namely, how Meta\u2019s incentive system rewards empire building. But it appears that changes are coming and more Metamates will lose their jobs. I hope the top management will at least cut their own bonus deeply to show some respect for employees who lose jobs due to their decisions based on overly optimistic outlook.

Tesla had been raising prices aggressively in 2022, only to cut the prices all at once two weeks ago. I understand they try to price their cars  based on supply and demand but as a consumer, I don\u2019t like to play this game. As mentioned previously, I bought a model X Plaid last year. I placed the order in 2021 and the price went up $15K in 2022. The sales rep told us we got a good deal as we were still paying the 2021 price. But then they just dropped the price by $21K so we actually didn\u2019t get a very good deal in the end. This price volatility is not very pleasant and for people who take out loans for their vehicles last year, they probably have very negative equity at the moment.

It is also reported that prior to this round, Microsoft already poured $3B into OpenAI and the deal structure is highly unusual. What Microsoft receives from this strategic investment is not equity but capped future revenue share. Basically, OpenAI will pay $X billions of future profits back to Microsoft in exchange for the $13B(?) investments in total. Microsoft is partnering with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into the Bing search and offer OpenAI\u2019s API service through Azure. Strategically, it makes a lot of sense for Microsoft to do this even if they don\u2019t make a lot of money directly from this investment. \nAccording to ChatGPT, OpenAI was initially founded as a non-profit research company in December 2015 by Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever, Wojciech Zaremba, and John Schulman, with the goal to develop and promote friendly AI in a way that benefits all of humanity. In 2018, the company changed its status to a C-corporation, which is a for-profit company structure. The reason for this change was to enable OpenAI to raise money through venture capital, allowing it to develop its own products and services in addition to its research. It is also worth mentioning that OpenAI has a number of high-profile individuals and organizations who have invested in the company such as Reid Hoffman, Peter Thiel, Mark Zuckerberg, and Elon Musk, among others. \nI believe OpenAI was started to advance public good as a non-profit. It made some amazing progress but in order to make even more progress, they need to raise a lot of money to hire AI scientists and to acquire computational power. They decided to reorganize as C-corp makes fundraising more accessible. (One can also cynically interpret the c-corp conversion as a way for a small number of investors to capture value created from the OpenAI.) I could understand this reorganization but the current owner list according to the public information is worrisome. If OpenAI is able to achieve AGI and become a very powerful force to influence humanity, do we really want a bunch of billionaires and Microsoft to be the owners and dictate what they want to do with this powerful technology? It seems OpenAI put in some guard rails to prevent this over-influence with the special deal structure. I would like to urge OpenAI to make a public disclosure on how their ownership structure works so that the amazing technologies don\u2019t just fall into hands for a very small group of already powerful individuals.\u00a0 \n \nNote: ChatGPT is wrong.

But now we are in a new era where cost of capital is a lot higher and valuations are being weighed down by the gravity of normalized 4-5% interest rates. \nI feel it\u2019s a bit silly to make this prediction. It\u2019s like predicting a hangover after consuming too much alchohol at a fancy party the previous night. But here we are. The party is over. We must deal with the aftermath. It\u2019s not going to be pretty but great founders will make it work and get a lot done with less. I am looking forward to their resourcefulness.\u00a0 \nWill the IPOs come back? I believe we are going to see some IPOs in 2023. Many late stage companies issued RSUs with a 10-year expiration\u00a0so they are going to IPO for their employees albeit with a lower valuation. Instacart is probably going to pull the trigger this year but its valuation will be a fraction of their $39B valuation in 2021. Their most recent 409A valuation was already down to $10B. Instacart is currently facing many headwinds such as high interest rates, high labor costs, inflation and competition from DoorDash. If they can IPO at $10B, I would think that is a very good outcome."}, {"title": "1/4/2023: 2023 Prediction: Battered SaaS Stocks are Now Reasonably Priced", "post_id": "94674106.142023-2023-prediction-battered-saas", "subtitle": "It's a good time to buy cloud stocks with low PS ratio", "content": " \n2022 was brutal for SaaS companies. Even the bellwether SaaS company, Salesforce, was down 50+% from ATH and the company just announced that they are laying off 10% of its workforce. SaaS companies as a whole are experiencing a corporate spending slowdown and many are down 80+% from their ATH. According to the data published in May 2022 as shown above, the median Enterprise Value to ARR ratio had dipped from 16 to 7, which was already below the historical mean of 7.9. Fast forward to Nov 30, 2022, the ratio has gone down further to 6.3, which is actually good news. The valuation reset presents opportunities to invest in high quality companies at reasonable valuations. I believe many high growth SaaS companies are now investable and in a way they are less risky than big tech companies like Microsoft and Apple, which have become overvalued crowded trades. \nThis is quite speculative but I predict that the high growth SaaS companies with low price-to-sales ratios are going to do better than SPY 0.00 for 2023. More specifically, I think the following five companies on average are going to do better than SPY 0.00 .\u00a0\u00a0 \n \nAll five companies have $1B+ annual revenue, are cash flow positive with positive revenue growth and have below average price to sales ratios. I believe all 5 companies have sufficient scale to weather this downturn. Given that investors in general have pretty low expectations for these companies, they might end up beating expectations a lot and their stocks will do better than SPY 0.00. Please keep in mind that *better* doesn\u2019t mean *positive*. It\u2019s possible that SPY 0.00 falls 30% and these stocks only fall 20%. In that case, they will do better than SPY 0.00 but still lose money as a whole. \nWhile I like this prediction game, nobody really knows the future. I am making these predictions primarily from the value and sentiment perspective. These stocks were battered so much that investors are afraid of dipping their toes into them and that\u2019s precisely why it's a good time to invest in them. These companies have strong fundamentals and recognizable brand names. Now investors can finally buy their stocks at reasonable prices.

It appears the next domino to fall is gonna be DCG/Genesis. Gemini\u2019s survival is also questionable. Yesterday Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss sent a letter of ultimatum to DCG CEO Barry Silbert, asking Genesis to pay back the $900M user deposits that were lent to Genesis. (Note: Genesis is a fully owned subsidiary of DCG.) Here is a quick recap of what happened. When FTX collapsed, it triggered bank runs across many centralized exchanges. Gemini is one of them. AFAIK, Gemini\u2019s own exchange backs the user deposits 1-to-1. But Gemini has a special program called Gemini Earn where users can agree to lend their deposits out to earn interest. Gemini Earn users can request withdrawals any time for any reason. It all sounded good but what really happened was that Gemini Earn deposits were lent out to Genesis and Genesis had trouble meeting withdrawal requests after the FTX collapse. In the Gemini Earn TOS, Gemini is purely a middleman that is only brokering between Genesis and retail users. Gemini itself doesn\u2019t take any default risks on the loan principals. Instead, the default risk is taken by Gemini Earn users. So when Genesis couldn\u2019t meet the withdrawal requests, theoretically Gemini is not responsible for it. But of course the reality is more complicated. Gemini users accused Gemini of false advertising on the Earn product and Gemini lost the majority of the user deposits because trust has been lost after the withdrawals were halted. Gemini has a very strong incentive to make sure that Gemini Earn users are made whole. Hence, the letter of ultimatum. \nSo .. why does Genesis have trouble meeting withdrawal requests? According to the letter, DCG owed $1.675B to Genesis. $1.1B is the loss DCG covered for Genesis when 3AC blew up. It was structured as a 10-year term loan. The remaining $575M DCG borrowed from Genesis was allegedly being used to make venture investments and fund share buybacks. With this ginormous $1.675B outstanding loan from the parent company, Genesis has a liquidity problem to pay back the lenders and potentially a solvency problem. DCG was trying to raise money to resolve the situation but it seems that they couldn\u2019t find any investors willing to pony up $500M+ to make it work and things are stuck with no resolutions. \nCameron Winklevoss is trying to force DCG\u2019s hand here. Gemini\u2019s magical thinking is that DCG can somehow come up with the money to make Gemini users whole. DCG\u2019s magical thinking is that they can wait it out to raise more money and sell their investments at good prices to make all the problems go away. The issue is that there\u2019s no liquidity flowing into crypto right now and perhaps for the next 18 months. Retail users are mostly gone and disgusted. Institutional users think crypto is toxic. The price manipulation game through leverage is long gone. What is most likely to happen is that Gemini forces Genesis/DCG into involuntary bankruptcy and it would cause more deleveraging and selling. I won\u2019t be surprised that we see another major downtick of BTC to say below $10K. But I won\u2019t be buying any BTC, ETH or any other cryptos. I am personally tired of this crypto game. This crypto drama was initially fun to watch but I am also getting tired of it. I don\u2019t really see any appeal of investing in cryptos while I can invest in productive companies like Okta or Disney. At the same time, I don\u2019t think the crypto speculation is going to go away unless regulators toughen up. People like to gamble and this madness will probably continue through another boom/bust greed/fear cycle. But guess what? I don\u2019t care and I don\u2019t want to be involved.\u00a0I will have fun staying poor but at least I won\u2019t inadvertently support a bunch of criminals.

Market is closed today but we already have some news coming in. Tesla announced their Q4 deliveries number today and it\u2019s not pretty. Tesla missed analysts\u2019 estimates of 420,000 vehicle deliveries for Q4 and it appears that they don\u2019t sell out all the vehicles they produce any more as shown in the tweet above. In other words, they start to have consumer demand problems as previously mentioned. It\u2019s unclear what\u2019s going to happen to the TSLA 0.00 stock tomorrow but any richly-valued stock missing expectations is going to be severely punished in the current environment. \nStocks are still expensive. SPY 0.00\u2019s CAPE ratio is currently ~28 (while the historical median is ~16). With the interest rate at 4.25%, investors most likely have less appetite for equity as they can earn a risk free return of ~4.25%. Many public companies used to borrow to buy back their stocks to boost their EPS. That playbook is no longer working with the high borrowing costs. In addition, borrowing just becomes more expensive so it\u2019s harder to grow profitably with debt. In Tesla\u2019s case, higher interest rates directly impact consumer demand as most people buy their car with credit. Higher interest rates make their car payments more expensive. I don\u2019t believe the high interest rate environment has been fully priced into large index funds like SPY 0.00. But once the companies start to miss their earnings, we may start to see a sentiment change even on index funds. Let\u2019s not forget that SPY 0.00 fell for 3 straight years from 2000 to 2002. I don\u2019t know if we are going to see something similar but to me, the insane level of irrational exuberance at the end of 2021 feels very similar to the beginning of the year 2000. \n2022 was a pretty rough year for big tech. Stocks for Facebook, Amazon and Tesla all fell more than 50% from their ATH. Google fell ~40% from ATH. Apple and Microsoft are relatively strong and only fell ~25% each. But Apple\u2019s PE is now 21 while Microsoft\u2019s PE is 26. I think both are a bit overvalued given Apple is mostly a hardware business and both have <10% top line growth rates. I believe Apple and Microsoft stocks are quite vulnerable to disappointing quarterly earnings and I won\u2019t be shocked to see AAPL 0.00 goes below $100 and MSFT 0.00 goes below $200 in 2023. They are both great companies but not necessarily great investments at current prices. This is pure speculation but if people start to pull out of SPY 0.00 index funds, Apple and Microsoft stocks will be greatly affected as they each represent more than 5% of the index weights for S&P 500.  \n2023 is probably going to be another volatile year for stock markets. I might consider buying the dip if there\u2019s a 20% correction from the current levels. \u00a0If there\u2019s no such correction, I am happy earning 4.25% on my cash reserve and watch it from the sidelines.

SPY 0.00 returned -19% in 2022 while QQQ 0.00 returned -33%, the worst since the great recession in 2008. I hope I am wrong but I believe the downward trend will continue in 2023 as the zero interest rate era comes to an end and asset prices reset to levels reflecting proper risk/reward characteristics. With that, here are my five predictions for the investment and tech world in 2023. \nS&P 500 will set new lows in 2023 since the ATH in December 2021. AAPL 0.00 stock will go under $100. The CAPE ratio is still too high and SPY 0.00 is due for a further correction. \nCrypto winter continues. The DCG situation is still not resolved. Tether and Binance are ticking time bombs. It\u2019s quite likely that BTC will go below $10,000. But BTC will probably rebound eventually as it goes through another boom/bust greed/fear cycle. \nCloud stocks stabilize. Cloud stocks crashed hard this year. But because they went down so much, I believe they will actually do better next year. I predict the average return of ZM 0.00 , OKTA 0.00 , DOCU 0.00 , PLTR 0.00 , and TWLO 0.00 will beat SPY 0.00 in 2023.\u00a0\u00a0 \nInstacart IPOs with a sub $10B valuation. Companies like Instacart really need to IPO so the employee RSUs don\u2019t become worthless. I believe the IPOs will happen but the valuations will be disappointing to many investors. The lower IPO valuations will continue to cause a chain reaction to the startup valuations in earlier stages. Many startups will fold. It will be another tough year for venture capital. \nCivil Unrest in China. After a couple of COVID waves, China will start to return to normal. But too much damage has been done to its economy and its financial system and real estate market are on brink. The majority of Chinese citizens are already experiencing financial hardships and many local governments are bankrupt. All these financial troubles could lead to major civil unrest and how CCP handles it could determine the fate of China and the global economy. \nI will elaborate on each prediction next week. But the general theme is that 2023 is a continuation of 2022. It\u2019s not going to be pretty but we all have to go along with it.

Here are a few predictions for the business and tech world in the coming year: \nRemote work will continue to be a major trend. Even as vaccines roll out and the pandemic comes under control, many companies will continue to allow employees to work from home at least part-time. This shift has already changed the way we work and will likely have long-lasting effects on office culture and the job market. \nE-commerce will continue to grow. The pandemic has accelerated the shift to online shopping, and this trend is likely to continue even after the pandemic ends. Businesses that can effectively sell their products and services online will have a competitive advantage. \nThe role of technology in our daily lives will continue to expand. From smart home devices to artificial intelligence, technology is becoming increasingly integrated into our daily routines. Companies that can effectively leverage these technologies will be well-positioned for success. \nSocial media and online marketing will become even more important. As more and more businesses shift to online sales and marketing, the importance of social media and other online platforms will only continue to grow. Companies that can effectively reach and engage with their audience online will have a significant advantage. \nSustainability and social responsibility will continue to be important.

At the end of 2021, I couldn\u2019t have imagined that 2022 would be such a tough year for tech and venture. I wish I had recorded my thoughts back then so I could do better reflections. It\u2019s great that now I have this blog and it will be easier to look back a year from now. At the end of 2021, all the asset classes were massively overvalued. Most people were aware of it but I don\u2019t think people expected the corrections to be so fast and violent. People might have different opinions but as an early stage investor, to me the following are the 5 biggest surprises for 2022: \nInterest Rates went from 0% to 4.25% : In late 2021 when the Fed Funds rate were at zero, one of the top Fed official said the Fed will start raising rates in early 2023. Look at where we are right now. And back in July 2022, the consensus was that the Fed will raise rates to 3% by the end of year and start cutting in 2023. Look where we are right now. This is such a big surprise and has a huge impact on our economy. \nAmazon and Meta laid off 11K people respectively: Many tech companies started laying off people in the second half of 2022 after huge hiring sprees in 2020 and 2021. At the beginning of 2022, people were talking about quiet quitting and the great resignation. The sentiment changed fast and now white-collar workers are worried about their job security. I expected companies without strong fundamentals would start cutting costs but I didn\u2019t expect this would happen to Amazon and Meta. \nTotal crypto meltdown driven by frauds and stupidity: Cryptos were massively overvalued at the end of 2021. I expected a correction but I didn\u2019t expect there\u2019re so many frauds in the billion dollar crypto businesses like Celsius and FTX. All the major crypto lenders also went under: BlockFi, Genesis, Celsius. These lenders lend money to big successful *institutional investors* like 3AC, Alameda, LFG who basically gambled away all the money and are now bankrupt. I am so shocked by how stupid and grift-y the whole crypto thing is. \nCloud stocks down 80+%: Newly IPO tech stocks had a super tough 2022. Yes, they were all overvalued in 2021 but I didn\u2019t expect so many of them went down 80+% from ATH i.e. ASAN 0.00 PLTR 0.00 AFRM 0.00 UPST 0.00 and many many others. \nStartup Funding Winter: Startup valuations were very frothy at the end of 2021 and many startups could raise millions with just an idea. But now at the end of 2022, it\u2019s a complete 180. Many startups which are growing well couldn\u2019t raise additional funding and many will shut down in 2023. I expected a correction but the current environment looks almost apocalyptic. \nThe general theme for 2022 is that many investors expected a correction but what they got was a huge crash, which is triggered by the quick increase of interest rates and massive overvaluations. I am still going to make some predictions for 2023 on Friday but I expect I will get the direction right but magnitude wrong again. Magnitude is kind of impossible to get right. In general, I don\u2019t make decisions fully based on my predictions. I make sure I don\u2019t get wiped out even if I am awfully wrong. With that, I can say I survived 2022 but it\u2019s a very very tough year. I am a bit dreadful of 2023 but hopefully I can survive it too.\u00a0"}, {"title": "12/27/2022: Know Your Purpose", "post_id": "93277352.12272022-know-your-purpose", "subtitle": "Money is the means to the end, not the end itself.

In the book, the author interviewed *the masters* of the investment world including Larry Fink, Sam Zell, Ray Dalio and many others. To my surprise, this book is mostly about investment business, not about investment returns. In a business, there are specific customers the business serves and products and services the business delivers. It\u2019s a good reminder that the investment businesses are not really about delivering some target returns. It is about achieving goals for their customers. Individuals and institutions\u2019 ultimate goals are not about the money itself but what they use the money for. In other words, money is the means to the end, not the end itself. The goals are specific and tangible i.e. covering tuitions for 1000 underprivileged kids per year, supporting breast cancer research or generating sufficient cashflow for living expenses for a family for four. \nI believe many people took on too much risk in the past decade. Although I did a lot of risky stuff, I had a financial advisor back in 2012 after the Facebook IPO . After we clarified our family\u2019s life goals, he put us into a very conservative 60/40 portfolio which we still stick to after all these years. It was clear to us that this portfolio is the endowment that will fund my family\u2019s living expenses perpetually. The main goal is to generate sufficient income and to keep up with inflation to cover our living expenses. The annualized return is much lower than SPY 0.00 in the past decade but it does what it\u2019s supposed to do. All my risky bets are outside this portfolio but I can really take a lot of risks because I have something to fall back on even if all my risky investments go to zero. \nIt was quite shocking to me that some people took risks on individual stocks, cryptos and margin loans without something else to fall back on. I believe it\u2019s an issue of not knowing the real purpose of their investments i.e. financial independence. In silicon valley, I have seen people have goals like getting to XXX millions of net worth even when they already have XX millions, which I believe is quite unhealthy and it\u2019s probably the main reason why people get caught up in the FOMO mania and margin loans because they want to get higher returns. What ends up happening is people take risks on the money they need for their family\u2019s financial security in order to have more money they don\u2019t actually need. And now, a down market is backfiring on this unnecessary risk taking. 2022 is a great reminder for all investors that we need to make sure we have the right priorities first, before foolishly chasing returns we might not actually need.\u00a0"}, {"title": "12/26/2022: Covid Tsunami in China", "post_id": "93095691.12262022-covid-tsunami-in-china", "subtitle": "Darkness before dawn", "content": " \nChina is experiencing a huge COVID surge at the moment.

Tesla mostly holds no inventory for the past couple of years as the cars were sold before they were built but things seem to be changing. Tesla started offering $7,500 discounts on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles delivered in the United States this month, signaling a consumer demand shift for its cars.

They can meet any customer withdrawals and all the clients assets are backed one to one. This sounds awfully familiar to what SBF said right before FTX collapsed. I will be quite shocked if Binance turns out to do the same horrendous things FTX did. But less bad doesn\u2019t mean good. There are so many red flags from Binance. I won\u2019t be too surprised if it ends up collapsing. Hopefully they made enough money in 2020 and 2021 to cover their losses in 2022. But these offshore exchanges need to be regulated in the long term to avoid more fiascos down the road. \nOver the weekend, Dirty Bubble Media who first published the analysis about Alameda solvency issues published a scathing post titled: \u201cIs Binance.US a Fake Exchange?\u201d as shown below. The tl;dr version of the post is that Binance.US commingles its crypto assets with Binance.com according to the blockchain data. Billions of cryptos were being sent back and forth between Binace.US and Binance.com\u2019s exchange wallets. Binance\u2019s claim that Binance.com and Binance.US are completely separate entities and only share technologies seems bogus. After the publication, instead of responding to the post, CZ blocked Dirty Bubble Media. WOW! Can someone report to the FBI/SEC to trigger a proper investigation so we know what\u2019s really going on? It\u2019s possible that the crypto transfers between these two exchanges were initiated by customers but CZ\u2019s response really made this possibility unlikely.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n  \nThis morning Reuters published a post about Binance\u2019s lack of transparency and regulatory oversight and its intention to remain opaque and unregulated. Binance declines to say where Binance.com is based!!!??? They have a lot of local entities but it\u2019s not clear what the relationships are between the main Binance.com entity and the local entities. It\u2019s also alleged that Binance's former chief financial officer, Wei Zhou, did not have access to the company's full accounts during his three-year tenure!!!??? The Reuter\u2019s post didn\u2019t raise any issue about Binance\u2019s solvency and estimated their revenue to be in billions based on their trading volume of $34.5 trillions last year. \nBinance\u2019s finances remain a mystery. This lack of transparency and regulatory oversight is concerning. Binance operates a super risky derivative exchange through perpetual contracts where customers can lever up to 10X. They claim they have a great risk management program. But there have been so many crypto blackswan events in the past year. Some of their customers were probably wiped out and had negative balances. Nobody knows how much loss Binance incurred during those volatile periods and Binance doesn\u2019t intend to tell anybody. If their losses are manageable, then Binance customers are probably okay for now. But if their losses are catastrophic and make Binance insolvent, what do you think they will do? There are really only three options: \nRaise money from investors through debt or equity \nFile for bankruptcy \nDip into customer funds \nRaising more money is unlikely under the current macro environment. Filing for bankruptcy is the last resort option. When under a desperate situation, most unregulated exchanges will probably opt for dipping into customer funds . They probably didn\u2019t intend to steal customer funds when they started the exchange but when they lost so much money during volatile periods and became insolvent, most likely they would dip into the customer funds before filing for bankruptcy if there\u2019s no regulatory oversight. In other words, regulatory oversight is necessary to make sure these exchanges don\u2019t misappropriate customer funds because the temptations are simply too hard to resist. They all think they can make the money back to repay the customers.  \nDid I also mention Biance\u2019s auditing partner Mazars quit last week? The extra revenue was simply not worth the risk for the accounting firm. The accounting firm couldn\u2019t actually do the proper audit\u00a0 to assure the customers because there are many things Binance wouldn\u2019t allow the auditor to do. I believe what Binance customers could do right now is to withdraw their funds and wait for most funds to be withdrawn without hiccups. If that is the case, customers can probably use Binance as an exchange to buy and sell cryptos. I will advise people to move their cryptos out of Binance right after though. Binance might be solvent today after the stress test but due to the lack of transparency, you don\u2019t know if they will still be solvent tomorrow. \nUltimately, I don\u2019t think I could trust any offshore unregulated exchanges and let\u2019s not forget the main point of blockchains: trustless and decentralized. After all the crypto fiascos in 2022, customers only have themselves to blame if they choose to store their cryptos inside unregulated offshore centralized exchanges."}, {"title": "12/16/2022: Elon is Turning into a Tyrant", "post_id": "91119129.12162022-elon-is-turning-into-a-tyrant", "subtitle": "smh", "content": "My hopes and dreams for Elon to make Twitter an unbiased platform that balances free speech and content moderation have been shattered.

Tweeting this is going to  incite a lot of public anger or even violence toward Dr. Fauci.   \nSomeone on the internet summarized the saga well: \u201cFragile Narcissist Buys Criticism Factory\".

According to the startup law firm Cooley, valuations and volumes are dropping across the board for venture deals in Q3 2022. Cooley handled 298 venture financings for Q3 2022 with $8.1B total raised, down from 332 deals and $16.6B raised for Q2 2022 and 401 deals and $24.3B in Q1 2022. The deal pace is the slowest since Q4 2019. \nI am not too surprised with these numbers. My theory is that easy money has been fueling the irrational exuberance across asset classes in the past decade. The free money during 2020 and 2021 pushed many asset classes straight into speculative bubbles i.e. real estate, cryptos and pre-ipo stocks. The party is now over and we have to deal with the hangover and the mess that was created during the party. \nTwo early stage companies I invested in shut down this past week. Chances are there are many more to come in 2023. I didn\u2019t really invest in companies with outrageous valuations and aggressive burns during the 2020-2021 super bull cycle. I heard a good number of them have folded recently. I believe I mostly invested in prudent and resourceful founders. But some businesses require a lot of capital to build and grow and it\u2019s just a lot harder to raise money these days so they had to close. Some companies have been limping along for years but the tightening is the last straw that forced them to fold. It\u2019s already a pretty nerve wrecking year for early stage investors in 2022. 2023 is probably going to be worse than 2022 and the brutal J-curve bottom will likely land sometime in 2024. I am hopeful that I will come out of this downtown stronger but the pains will be inevitable.\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"title": "12/14/2022: Fed Raised Rates by 0.5%", "post_id": "90741261.12142022-fed-raised-rates-by-05", "subtitle": "Target rate now is 4.25% - 4.5% ", "content": "As expected, the Fed raised FFR (federal-funds rates) by 50 basis points to 4.25% - 4.5% today, a 15-year high.

No surprise here. \nFor this meeting, they also release economic and rate projections by the FOMC members. The most recent rate projections are higher than the September one. The median projection for the FFR is now 5.1% for 2023 and 4.1% for 2024. This means we are going to see risk free investments yielding close to 5% in 2023 and it will probably be a very difficult year for rate sensitive industries like real estate and manufacturing. \nBut I do think this tightening is healthy and can clean out over leveraged toxic assets in our financial system and impede unsustainable business growth. I also get to earn 5% on my cash holdings. Some people seem to believe that the Fed will start cutting interest rates aggressively in 2023 because of the rapid slowdown of the economy and liquidity crunch. I disagree.

We are seeing further relief of consumer prices across the board. Overall CPI rose 0.1% in November vs. 0.4% in October while the core CPI rose 0.2% in November vs 0.3% in October. Overall CPI YoY rose 7.1% in November vs. 7.7% in October. Core CPI YoY rose 6.0% in November vs. 6.3% in October. In general, this is positive news. With this CPI report, there\u2019s no compelling reason for the Fed to make another 75 basis point hike. But it\u2019s also unlikely for them to step on the brake and to only raise 25 basis points when the tightening is finally working. Chances are the Fed will raise the federal fund rate 50 basis points tomorrow. \nThis report is concise and the key points are summarized in the beginning of the reports as follows: \nThe index for shelter was by far the largest contributor to the monthly all items increase, more than offsetting decreases in energy indexes. The food index increased 0.5 percent over the month with the food at home index also rising 0.5 percent. The energy index decreased 1.6 percent over the month as the gasoline index, the natural gas index, and the electricity index all declined. The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.2 percent in November, after rising 0.3 percent in October. The indexes for shelter, communication, recreation, motor vehicle insurance, education, and apparel were among those that increased over the month. Indexes which declined in November include the used cars and trucks, medical care, and airline fares indexes. \nThe all items index increased 7.1 percent for the 12 months ending November; this was the smallest 12- month increase since the period ending December 2021. The all items less food and energy index rose 6.0 percent over the last 12 months. The energy index increased 13.1 percent for the 12 months ending November, and the food index increased 10.6 percent over the last year; all of these increases were smaller than for the period ending October. \nInterestingly, the report also mentioned that cereals, milk, nonalcoholic beverages and bakery products are getting more expensive while meats, poultry, fish, and eggs are getting cheaper. I wonder why highly processed foods are getting more expensive while natural foods are getting cheaper. I suppose it\u2019s a good time to start a low-carb diet. I probably need to do that after all my festive eating during the holidays. \nIf the next few CPI reports are similar to the November one, I believe inflation fears will start to dissipate and the rate hiking cycle will finally be over. But I don\u2019t believe we will get back to the zero interest rate any time soon. People start to realize that the zero rate policy has serious consequences like over inflated asset prices that turn into speculative bubbles, unaffordable housing prices and high consumer price inflation. A neutral interest rate like 3-4% is probably healthier in the long run.\u00a0 \n "}, {"title": "12/12/2022: SBF is Finally Arrested ", "post_id": "90283612.12122022-sbf-is-finally-arrested", "subtitle": "He is charged with wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy and money laundering", "content": "It\u2019s over!

It\u2019s disgusting and I am glad we don\u2019t have to hear from him for a little while. \nI am also not optimistic that Binance is much better than FTX. The offshore unregulated exchanges just have too many temptations to misappropriate user funds. With the 2022 crypto market downtick, I imagine a lot of these exchanges lost a lot of money, especially platforms that allowed derivative trading and took on a lot of counterparty risks. If they are insolvent, they are not going to voluntarily file for bankruptcy. They either raise more money or they dip into the user funds. The former is unlikely given the current environment. The latter is basically a crime unless noted in the user agreement. Letting these unregulated CEX die is probably a good thing for the long run. My belief is you either be a regulated exchange like Coinbase or you be a completely transparent DeFi application like Uniswap.

Hiive Market\u2019s most recent report also indicated private transactions are traded at a 39.5% discount to the last primary round on average and there are twice as many sell orders as buy orders on their platform. \nOverall, it is no surprise that the private secondary markets are mirroring the public stocks\u2019 performance.

The boardroom conversations have gone from how to grow faster to how to become profitable for the pre-IPO tech companies. \nIf we look at the companies that have laid off people in the past couple of months like Meta, Asana, Stripe, Plaid, and AirTable, they all acknowledged that they had become undisciplined in hiring and the exploding headcount didn\u2019t necessarily translate to exploding growth or profits. Actually, the main characteristic of software business should be that the marginal cost of revenue is negligible as the software development cost is fixed and the cost difference of serving 10 clients vs. serving 10,000 vs. serving 1,000,000 clients should be about the same as these clients are using the same piece of software.

It can be caused by a number of factors, including excessive money printing, a sharp increase in government spending, or a lack of confidence in the currency. In the 1970s, many countries experienced hyperinflation as a result of high government spending on the Vietnam War and other global conflicts, as well as oil price shocks and other economic factors. These events contributed to a loss of confidence in the global monetary system and led to rapid increases in the price of goods and services. \n \nFinally I am quite impressed with ChatGPT\u2019s travel recommendations.

Take a stroll along the River Thames and see some of the city's famous bridges, such as Tower Bridge and London Bridge. In the evening, attend a theater performance or musical. \nDay 2: Visit the British Museum, which is one of the largest and most comprehensive museums in the world. The museum has an incredible collection of artifacts from around the world, including the Rosetta Stone and the Elgin Marbles. \nDay 3: Take a trip to the Royal Observatory in Greenwich and visit the Prime Meridian, which is the line of longitude that divides the eastern and western hemispheres. While you're in Greenwich, you can also visit the Cutty Sark, a 19th-century clipper ship that is now a museum. \nDay 4: Spend the day exploring some of London's beautiful parks, such as Hyde Park, Regent's Park, and St. James's Park. In the evening, try some traditional British cuisine, such as fish and chips or a roast dinner. \nDay 5: Visit the National Gallery, which has an extensive collection of European paintings from the 13th to the 19th centuries. Afterward, take a walk through Trafalgar Square and visit the National Portrait Gallery, which has a collection of portraits of famous Britons. \nDay 6: Take a trip out of the city to explore one of the nearby countryside areas, such as the Cotswolds or the Lake District. \nDay 7: Spend your last day in London shopping and exploring the city's markets, such as Camden Market and Borough Market. In the evening, attend a concert or show at one of London's many venues. \nAgain, these are just a few suggestions for activities you may want to consider during your trip to London. There are many other things to see and do in the city, and the best itinerary will depend on your interests and preferences. \nOverall, it\u2019s pretty impressive but it\u2019s still far away from AGI.

The Fed believes they need to keep the interest rate high at potentially 5+% to dampen the demand for labor and to slow down the wage growth to fight inflation. \nI have repeated the same point over and over again but it appears that the real issue here is the (lack of ) supply for labor. As the labor participation rate indicates, America simply has fewer people working currently compared to before the pandemic and American employers still have a lot of unfilled open positions.

He said a few important things about the interest rate and economic outlook: \nThe time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the December meeting but the inflation fight is far from over. \nMy colleagues and I do not want to overtighten because \u2026 cutting rates is not something we want to do soon. .. That\u2019s why we\u2019re slowing down, and I\u2019m going to try to find our way to what that right level is. \nThe labor market shows only tentative signs of rebalancing, and wage growth remains well above levels that would be consistent with 2% inflation. Despite some promising developments, we have a long way to go in restoring price stability.\u201d \nIn a nutshell, we are likely to see a 0.5% rate hike in December, ending the unprecedented streak of four consecutive 0.75% rate hikes in 2022. But we shouldn\u2019t expect the Fed to lower the interest rate any time soon. The inflation fight is far from over and the Fed is fine tuning the rate and intends to keep the rate steady for a while. \nIt will be really interesting to see what happens to various asset classes if the 4+% interest rate environment is here to stay. I personally feel good about holding some risk-free assets these days as the 12-month treasury bill is currently paying 4.74%. Sure it doesn\u2019t beat inflation but it\u2019s not clear to me that other asset classes could do better. Frankly, I like this higher interest rate environment better.

Beijing has softened the tone and recommended against unnecessary and lengthy lockdowns. But it doesn\u2019t appear that China will switch off their Zero Covid policy. They just want to execute the Zero Covid policy with more precision and less lockdowns. I don\u2019t understand how that could possibly work as the rest of the world has decided to live with COVID and although it\u2019s not perfect, we are pretty much back to normal. Huge crowds are currently watching WorldCup in person without masks and that is a shocker for many Chinese people. They are tired of the constant lockdowns and incessant PCR tests. Many people are broke. Through WorldCup, Chinese people see other possibilities. They want to live like people in other countries but this zero COVID ideology is holding them back. The protests are the last resort to get their freedom back. \nAs a Taiwanese, I would like to tell you the story of how Taiwan exited their zero COVID policy and transitioned to live with COVID. Taiwan ended all the COVID restrictions recently. It\u2019s a huge relief for me as my family and I no longer need to quarantine when we travel back. \nTaiwan had been doing really well with a very low number of COVID cases up until early 2022. But as the world opened up, their COVID restrictions became an obstacle to participating in the global economy.  Plus, there\u2019s really no end game for continuing this scorched-earth zero COVID policy. To keep up with America and the rest of the world, they decided to switch the policy from zero COVID to living with COVID. Let me tell you this switch was not an easy policy to implement as the COVID infections and deaths skyrocketed. They went from less than 1000 deaths on 5/1/2022 to 14,000+ deaths today. And this was after ~90% of the population getting vaccinated with at least 2 shots. There were actually some objections to the policy switch because of the projected deaths but they decided to go with it anyway. It was super nerve wrecking when the policy was first implemented and my own 73 year-old mother got COVID. But my mom was fine in the end as most other people who got COVID. Taiwan eventually came out of the huge wave of COVID cases and deaths and they can now live normally. Most Taiwanese people agree with the government\u2019s decision of making the policy change. But there is really no perfect solution here. There\u2019s only the less than perfect solution of living with COVID and the worse than bad non-solution of zero COVID. I am so glad that Taiwan didn\u2019t become a victim of its own zero COVID success. They bit the bullet and ended the pains quickly.  \nBut here is the thing. If China abolishes the zero COVID policy, they are going to see a shocking number of COVID deaths. Compared to Taiwan, their COVID death rates will probably be higher as they are not using the more effective mRNA vaccines and their healthcare system is fragile. But even if we assume China can achieve the same death rate as Taiwan, since China\u2019s population is roughly 60X of Taiwan\u2019s, we are talking about 14276 * 60 = 856,560 COVID deaths in a very short period of time. It\u2019s highly likely if China decided to live with COVID, they would have more than the USA\u2019s 1.1M COVID deaths, which will be a very bitter pill to swallow.  But if China wants to get out of this COVID nightmare, I don\u2019t see any other way out. Zero COVID policy simply cannot last forever otherwise it risks turning into the second cultural revolution.\u00a0"}, {"title": "11/28/2022: BlockFi Files for Bankruptcy ", "post_id": "87443550.11282022-blockfi-files-for-bankruptcy", "subtitle": "Their business model was never sustainable", "content": "BlockFi files for chapter 11 Bankruptcy today There\u2019s no surprise here. BlockFi blamed the filing on the falling crypto prices and the FTX debacle but the truth is that their business model was never sustainable. It was also disclosed in the filing that Alameda Research defaulted on $680 million owed to BlockFi earlier this month. WOW! BlockFi\u2019s top 10 creditors alone are owed close to $1.2 billion and the total amount owed is probably much larger. Chances are depositors will only get a very small fraction of their money back. \nAs previously mentioned, I regretted making an investment into BlockFi back in 2020. I was blindsided by BlockFi\u2019s hyper growth and I thought the founders are not scammers and genuinely wanted to make BlockFi work. However, their business model was flawed from day one. They grew like weeds because they paid customers a very juicy ~10% on crypto deposits like USDC and ETH. As a crypto \u201cbank\u201d, their supposed business model is to lend the deposits to \u201cinstitutions\u201d at a much higher rate with supposedly very little risk as these institutions can yield farm at a 20+% return and BlockFi can make the spread on borrowing and lending rates. It turns out these \u201cinstitutions\u201d are basically 3AC, Alameda and LUNA/LFG, which are all bankrupt and defaulted on their loans. And the 20+% return on yield farming is mostly funded by venture capitalists. When the VC money eventually ran out, things started to fall apart. There are just not that many crypto projects who can productively generate 20+% IRR from their \u201cinvestments\u201d. \nCustomers deposited their money into BlockFi to make 10% but it looks like they will end up losing most of their deposits due to the bankruptcy. The \u201cinstitutional borrowers\u201d like 3AC, Alameda and LFG are now bankrupt. Venture investors are completely wiped out. It seems that everybody loses and nobody wins in the case of BlockFi. The CEOs of FTX and Celsius Network were at least living large and making themselves famous. But I have difficulty figuring out who the winner really is in the case of BlockFI. It\u2019s tragic. \nIn the same vein, I believe Genesis is also completely screwed. They have exactly the same business model and the same \u201cinstitutional borrowers\u201d as BlockFi but with a bigger balance sheet. I don\u2019t know how Genesis and its parent company DCG can possibly get out of this mess cleanly as Genesis is obviously and probably deeply insolvent. My bet is that we are going to see a huge downtick on crypto in the coming weeks when the Genesis/DCG saga unfolds and another tsunami of liquidations hits.\u00a0 \n  \n \n \n"}, {"title": "11/25/2022: Riots at China's Largest iPhone Factory", "post_id": "86821835.11252022-riots-at-chinas-iphone-factory", "subtitle": "Many parts of China are still locked down", "content": "It appears that China is still locking down their people to achieve zero COVID. This time it sparked huge riots in the largest iPhone Factory operated by FoxConn in Zhengzhou, China. The 200,000 person factory has been in total isolation for weeks and the workers are working in grueling shifts to churn out iPhones. On Nov. 23 hundreds of workers, angry to learn that they need to stay through mid-March to get the $10K RMB (about $1400 USD) per month pay advertised, pushed past the security staff guarding their living quarters, setting off huge riots. It\u2019s total chaos as shown in the video above. Considering the restrictions and the working environment the Foxconn workers are facing, it\u2019s understandable why this happened. \nFoxconn later apologized for the *misunderstanding* about the work contract. Many workers thought they only needed to work until the end of November to receive their $10K RMB/month pay and it\u2019s optional for them to stay through Chinese New Year and into Spring next year. But apparently, the recruiting advertisements (written by the local government officials) have some discrepancy from the actual contract and the workers actually need to stay in the factory for at least another three months to get the pay. This made the workers super frustrated. Foxconn later resolved the issue by giving all the workers the option to leave the factory immediately and to receive at least $10K in pay. Many workers started their job in October before the strict lockdown. But the COVID cases started skyrocketing and the whole factory was locked down. The workers didn\u2019t have enough food to eat and their dormitories were littered with trash. It\u2019s basically a living hell that most people will want to escape from. But these workers were lured by the good pay and big brand names like Apple and Foxconn.\u00a0 \nI am glad that the situation is now under control.

Disney\u2019s theme parks are doing well but they are losing a lot of money on streaming. It is reported that some members in the executive team are not satisfied with former CEO Bob Chapek\u2019s management style and his many missteps. They took the issue to the board.

So in two weeks, Twitter went from 7500 employees to roughly 2500 employees. It\u2019s reported that a number of teams have nobody left to carry out the day to day operations and people worry that Twitter might stop functioning. But it has been about 5 days and I don\u2019t have any issues using Twitter. It remains to be seen if this mass exodus has any significant negative long term impact. I do think it\u2019s quite a risky move from Elon to make so many changes in such a short period of time. But I hope things work out in the end.  \nGoing forward, to build a breakthrough Twitter 2.0 and succeed in an increasingly competitive world, we will need to be extremely hardcore. This will mean working long hours at high intensity. Only exceptional performance will constitute a passing grade. \nTwitter will also be much more engineering-driven. Design and product management will still be very important and report to me, but those writing great code will constitute the majority of our team and have the greatest sway. At its heart, Twitter is a software and servers company, so I think this makes sense. \nIf you are sure that you want to be part of the new Twitter, please click yes on the link below: \n[Google form link]\u00a0 \nAnyone who has not done so by 5pm ET tomorrow (Thursday) will receive three months of severance. \nWhatever decision you make, thank you for your efforts to make Twitter successful. \nIn addition to the massive staff changes, Elon also reinstated many people back to the platform including Donald Trump after putting up a poll on Twitter. People thought the world would be ending when that happened but Donald Trump hasn\u2019t made any tweets since he was unbanned.  We will see what happens if he does come back. I do think this is a calculated move from Elon. He only reinstated Trump after more than 50% of support from the poll. The midterm election is over and the red wave didn\u2019t really materialize. The Trump phenomenon seems to be fading and with his deep business interest in Truth Social,  the risk of Trump coming back to Twitter and causing huge problems for them seems low. And Elon got to take a victory lap of free speech.  \nElon is also pausing the $8 per month verified account program as there are too many impersonations.  Someone got a verified check impersonating Eli Lilly and tweeted that  \u201cinsulin is free now\u201d, prompting chaos and tanking  stock.  Twitter obviously did a very shoddy job for this product launch that they need to do better.  \nElon\u2019s dramatic actions so far have prompted multiple culture wars including work ethics vs. work life balance, free speech vs. misinformation minimization and moving fast vs. moving thoughtfully. I could see arguments for both sides on many of the issues highlighted.  He is definitely taking a lot of risks most people of his stature wouldn\u2019t take but that\u2019s precisely how Elon Musk was made. I don\u2019t necessarily agree with a lot of his decisions but I appreciate his transparency and his speed of decisions and execution.

I didn\u2019t want to turn this blog into a crypto meltdown diary so I limit myself to only writing about crypto up to two times a week. Since my last crypto entry on 11/15, a lot has happened. First, let me start with sharing the following screenshot from SBF who DM\u2019ed with a reporter from Vox who wrote a super interesting article based on these DMs with SBF. I was shaking my head the whole time when reading it but I am stunned by his unapologetic tone when talking about his virtue signaling practice: \u201cThis dumb game we woke westerners play where we say all the right shibboleths so everyone likes us.\u201d WOW. Previously, I thought SBF just had his priorities wrong with regard to effective altruism. I was too charitable. The whole EA thing is just a front for him. He didn\u2019t even have good intentions to start with!! Aren\u2019t we glad that CZ burst his bubble? Imagine how much more damage he would have done if the whole FTX fiasco didn\u2019t happen and he gained more power. Karma is a bitch after all.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n \nIn his DMs with the reporter, he also literally said \u201cf**k regulators\u201d. Let\u2019s see how things will go down for him. AFAIK, he is still not arrested. But Elizabeth Holmes got 11 years in prison by losing $700M of investors money. SBF lost $1.8B of investor money and misappropriated $8B of user deposits. I suppose he should get 9.8/0.7*11 = 154 years in prison? \nThe other crazy thing happened is that one of the FTX *hackers* is actually the Bahamian government. The Bahamian government asked FTX to send all the digital assets to their wallets to *secure* user funds. It was very confusing as it appears there are multiple hackers and one *hacker* is the Bahamian government while the other hacker is converting ETH to renBTC and will probably unwrap the renBTC to BTC and make things harder to track. The Bahamian government is currently fighting with the US government on who has the authority over FTX bankruptcy. \nOn Thursday(11/7) , FTX made a new bankruptcy filing. In the filing, the CEO, who was the previously liquidator of Enron and has seen all kinds of corporate shenanigans, said: \nNever in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here.\u00a0 From compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad, to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals, this situation is unprecedented. \nWOW! Didn\u2019t FTX raise $1.8B of venture capital? Did the investors not look into their books or how their operation is run on a day to day basis? Supposedly they should have built out the whole corporate security and compliance systems given their size. In the filing, it was revealed that: \nEmployees of the FTX Group submitted payment requests through an online \u2018chat\u2019 platform where a disparate group of supervisors approved disbursements by responding with personalized emojis.\u00a0 \nWhat??!! Even my little startup has a lot of this stuff built out with Trinet, Airbase, Carta and some outside CPA, bookkeeping and legal support. I suppose a lot of FTX customers thought investors had done all the due diligence as FTX had a bunch of A-list investors like Sequoia and Tiger. And that\u2019s part of the reason why FTX customers trusted them. But it turned out SBF somehow manipulated the investors to not look into these important details and billions of dollars were lost this way. \nFinally, Genesis Trading halted customer withdrawals on Wednesday (11/16), citing FTX exposure. Gemini\u2019s earn program is impacted as Genesis is the backend provider. This is a big deal as Genesis is THE prime broker of crypto and is powering a lot of the crypto lending activities in the whole ecosystem. Genesis Trading\u2019s parent company DCG is trying to raise $1B to stay alive. It\u2019s hard to know all the details that led to this difficult situation. But basically, Genesis takes in customer deposits and lends the deposit to counter parties like 3AC and Alameda. The counter parties pay Genesis interest. Genesis takes a small cut of the received interest payments and sends the rest to the deposit customers. It works well when everyone is liquid and solvent. But many of the counter parties they lend to are now broke and it sounds like they also have some deposits that were lost on FTX. \nAnyway, Genesis doesn\u2019t have enough money to cover withdrawal requests. We don\u2019t know if it\u2019s simply a liquidity issue or it\u2019s a solvency issue. But if DCG goes bankrupt, it will be disastrous as DCG also owns Grayscale. Grayscale currently holds 650K BTC. If they are forced to liquidate all the BTC at once and return USD to customers, it could impact the BTC price a lot. BTC is currently trading at $15,861, down 4% WoW and 65% YTD. Crypto folks are super nervous right now. If DCG goes bankrupt and a lot of cryptos get dumped into the open market, the crypto prices will tank, which would cause even more liquidations. It will be an apocalyptic situation and I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s a central bank like entity out there to save crypto."}, {"title": "11/18/2022: Alibaba Reported Q3 Earnings", "post_id": "85441373.11182022-alibaba-reported-q3-earnings", "subtitle": "Revenue Miss.

As of now, the hacker has 228,000 ETH and other assets in their wallet. According to CoinTelegraph, the wallet draining is still ongoing. It\u2019s hard to believe that this is an actual hack. This feels more like an inside job. \nOver the weekend, FTX\u2019s balance sheet BEFORE the bankruptcy filing was leaked. Apparently, they only have $900M of easily sellable assets but have $9B of liabilities. The rests is basically s**tcoins like SRM or MAPS and illiquid venture investments. With the $450M+ hack, it appears that HOOD 0.00 stock is the only high quality asset that is left to repay users. What a s**tshow. \nShockingly and not shockingly, according to a WSJ report, in a video meeting with Alameda employees late Wednesday Hong Kong time, Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison said that she, Mr. Bankman-Fried and two other FTX executives, Nishad Singh and Gary Wang, were aware of the decision to send customer funds to Alameda. It\u2019s shocking because Ms. Ellison admitted fraud with a straight face to her team. It\u2019s not shocking because that\u2019s the only reason why they have such a big gap on their balance sheet. \nFinally, yesterday New York Times published a *puff* piece about SBF. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with the NYT. But they portrayed SBF as if this debacle is just another typical silicon valley failure, which is completely false. This is a very obvious fraud as Caroline Ellison admitted to her team and hundreds of thousands of FTX clients lost their life savings. SBF even bragged in the article that \u201cYou would\u2019ve thought that I\u2019d be getting no sleep right now, and instead I\u2019m getting some,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could be worse.\u201d I am speechless.

Psychopath SBF stepped down (but is not yet arrested). John Ray, the lawyer who oversaw Enron bankruptcy, is taking over. \nThings are likely going to get worse from here.

Projects which get quarterly infusions from FTX/Alameda might have to shut down or scale back. The Solana ecosystem is especially impacted as FTX/Alameda supports many projects there.\u00a0 SOL token also dropped 50% in value in the past week. I personally believe a big percentage of Solana\u2019s success/hype can be attributed to FTX/Alameda\u2019s support. With FTX/Alameda going under, who is going to pump up the SOL token price?

I know this is tough for everyone, and I\u2019m especially sorry to those impacted. \nWhen was the last time we heard Zuck apologize? If I remember correctly, that was years ago. I believe this is a material improvement. I know I came across super critical of the Facebook management. That\u2019s because I have very high expectations for them. The quality of their decisions matters. Look, the quality of my decisions basically doesn\u2019t matter. If I make a good early stage investment and the company turns out to be successful, it\u2019s great that I help create some jobs and new products/ services.

I am deeply disgusted by psychopath SBF, who told the public that he wants to make billions so that he can give it all away to charity. It turns out the way he made his billions was by gambling the money entrusted by FTX investors and users and like all gamblers, he eventually lost the money. A few hours ago, Binance walked away from bailing out FTX because the hole was too big. It is reported that the gap between liabilities and assets is probably in billions and possibly more than $6 billion.  It\u2019s unclear what\u2019s going to happen next but I hope FTX files for bankruptcy so the public will know what really happened. At this point, we can only speculate but the most likely scenario is that they misused user deposits for other purposes and possibly had large losses from trading and risk management operations.  \nIt\u2019s deeply ironic that SBF tried to project this do-gooder effective altruistic persona to the public. I suppose many people trusted him, including Sequoia Capital. But he is full of  egregious lies. Just one day before FTX went under, he tweeted in now deleted tweets:  \nSorry. But I couldn\u2019t give him the benefit of the doubt this time. If FTX didn\u2019t invest client assets, they should have had no problem meeting withdrawal requests. Frankly, I was very suspicious of SBF. Not just him, I am suspicious of any CEO who would put their own face on a giant company billboard. It\u2019s a big warning sign that the CEO is a narcissist and his staff are too scared to tell him how absurd it is. Anyway, I digressed. This is not the reason why I am disgusted. \nI was so disgusted yesterday evening I couldn\u2019t eat my dinner. As many of you know, I am not a big fan of philanthropy. The feedback loop is not straightforward and there\u2019s too much virtual signaling. But SBF really took virtual signaling to the next level and used the good will accumulated to effect his dirty lies to investors, users and regulators. In June 2022, he signed the giving pledge to announce to the world he will give away at least half of his multi-billion wealth. In an article published by Bloomberg, he declared he wants to give his fortune away by using the scientific approach of effective altruism to maximize impact per dollar. \nThis all sounds good. But while he was declaring his philanthropic goals, he was probably also busy using FTX user deposits to gamble in crypto, to purchase naming rights of FTX Arena and to spend lavishly in marketing and sponsorship deals. SBF failed his most basic fiduciary duty to protect user funds. Yet, he wants to be the savior and the effectively altruistic billionaire. He knew he was misusing user deposits. Yet, he went to DC to help write crypto regulations??!! How could someone do this in real life? It\u2019s beyond disgusting. \nHow does the son of two Stanford law professors, MIT educated wunderkind and a former director for center of effective altruism become a criminal crypto scammer? There\u2019s a lot for us to think about. But for all the big talk of philanthropy or effective altruism, I hope people focus on doing no harm first and doing good second.

WOW! WOW! Here I present to you the craziest story of crypto year-to-date. It\u2019s crazier than the Terra Luna fiasco, the 3AC Debacle or the Celsius Network insolvency. We don\u2019t have an exact number for how much money is lost. But it appears that FTX is being bailed out by Binance to stay solvent. FTX was previously valued at $32B this past January. I suppose FTX will be absorbed by Binance and the equity will be reset to zero. But this *acquisition* is still pending due diligence. The negative equity situation  cannot be ruled out. \nA series of unfortunate events led to FTX\u2019s bailout today. You can read the details here. The tl;dr version is that CZ has been mad at SBF for lobbying against Binance and DeFi in DC. Last week, FTX\u2019s sister company Alameda Research\u2019s balance sheet was leaked. It has $14.6B* of assets and $7.6B of outstanding loans. Out of the $14.6B assets, they got $5.8B in FTX token (FTT), $1.2B in Solana (SOL) and only $134M in cash. The rest of the assets are illiquid equity stakes and s**t tokens. Basically, this is a very shaky balance sheet that can easily become insolvent should FTT and SOL\u2019s values drop. Alameda research will also have imminent liquidity problems if the loans get called. It is speculated that the $7.6B loan is obtained from the FTX reserve. \nCZ saw a window of opportunity and tweeted the following Sunday evening (All timelines mentioned here are Pacific Time): \nBinance had 23 million FTT tokens and CZ wanted to dump it. When I read the tweet on Sunday evening, the first thing I did was to ask my teammate to pull all the funds out of our FTX US account. I believe many people did the same. CZ must know that FTX is operating using fractional reserve and he was determined to get them into trouble. SBF tweeted the following yesterday morning. \nMy first reaction was that he said FTX is fine. But he didn\u2019t say Alameda Research is also fine. I assume Alameda is in giant trouble. Yesterday evening, the FTT token dumping officially started. It went from ~$23 at the time of the CZ announcement to $15 last night and to $5 right now. Solana also went from $33 to $27 last night and to $24 right now. Net equity of Alameda Research\u2019s balance sheet dropped at least another $5B. We are talking about $9.6B of questionable assets and $7.6B of outstanding loans. Alameda Research is pretty deep in the liquidation territory. \nInvestors fled the FTX exchanges as a result. People started having trouble withdrawing money from FTX this morning. At the same time, SBF remained silent for the whole time. Then a nuclear bomb dropped. At around 8AM this morning, CZ tweeted the following: \nApparently, FTX has liquidity issues and doesn\u2019t have enough reserves to meet withdrawal requests so they have to be bailed out by Binance!!!  Binance knocked down their major competitor FTX in a day with just ~$500M of FTT tokens. WOW!! JP Morgan of Crypto, Savior of Robinhood, Effectively Altruistic Billionaire SBF is no more. I know I sound super mean but I am really not a fan of SBF\u2019s lobbying against DeFi. I always wonder how FTX could possibly buy all the near bankrupt CEX exchanges like BlockFi and Voyager and invest in all the new shiny projects like Aptos and Sui while running exchanges with only $1.8B of equity financing. It turns out they probably dipped into their user reserve like what Celsius Network did criminally. The loans lent to Alameda Research only made the whole situation worse. I suppose we'll never know the exact details of FTX\u2019s finances if the acquisition goes through. But I believe the bursting of the SBF bubble is good for DeFi and blockchain development. His excessive risk taking and political posturing is really not great for the crypto community. What an amazing hand CZ played.

Some people even borrowed against it and suffered significant financial loss that would be hard to recover.

I feel lucky I don\u2019t have to go through the emotional roller coaster when META 0.00 stock tanked in the past few months. I tried hard to understand why people take so many risks. I believe some of them don\u2019t realize there're risks but others recognize the risks but still take them because it\u2019s part of the striving mentality and growth mindset that makes Silicon Valley a leader of technological progress and new inventions. At the same time, this culture of growth can become a corrosive force that turns people into greedy money chasers. \nGrowth means there\u2019s not enough and we need more. From the financial perspective, this mindset shouldn\u2019t apply to people who have accumulated enough to diversify and become financially independent. But apparently, many people took risks of money they need in order to have more money they don\u2019t need. It\u2019s mind boggling. On the other hand, if you look around Silicon Valley, you won\u2019t be surprised why this excessive risk taking is happening. People who are worth 8-figures want to get to $100M+ and once they get there, they want to become billionaires. This behavior is usually disguised as future making or Warren Buffett style concentrated investing. But it\u2019s more often a very unhealthy addiction to money that is oddly celebrated in our culture.  \nIn his seminal essay \u201cEconomic Possibilities of Our Grandchildren\u201c published in 1930, John Maynard Keynes predicted that in 2030, our economy would compound so much due to technological improvements that people only need to work about 15 hours a week. He predicted that our economy would grow 4-8X in 100 years. According to Statistica, the real GDP for America grew 17.6X from 1930-2021 while the population grew 2.7X during the same period. Real GDP per capita hence grew 6.7X. Keynes was right about the economic progress but people are definitely not working 15 hours a week. He presciently predicted that while *the economic problem* might be solved, mankind will be deprived of its traditional purpose of solving it and will have difficulty adjusting to the new realities. What Keynes said is quite apt to our current environment where many affluent people couldn\u2019t deal with losing the traditional purpose of solving *the economic problem\u201d and blindly chase more money. The whole essay is amazing to read but I will just quote the following: \nThus for the first time since his creation man will be faced with his real, his permanent problem-how to use his freedom from pressing economic cares, how to occupy the leisure, which science and compound interest will have won for him, to live wisely and agreeably and well. \nThe strenuous purposeful money-makers may carry all of us along with them into the lap of economic abundance. But it will be those peoples, who can keep alive, and cultivate into a fuller perfection, the art of life itself and do not sell themselves for the means of life, who will be able to enjoy the abundance when it comes. \nIt is time for us to contemplate these words of wisdom from Keynes. Money is the means to the end, not the end itself. We should strive to enjoy the abundance to the fullest to elevate humanity when personal circumstances allow, instead of living in affluence without abundance by chasing growth at all costs.\u00a0"}, {"title": "11/4/2022: October Jobs Report Came In Hot", "post_id": "82550353.1142022-october-job-report-came-in", "subtitle": "", "content": " \nThe October job report is out. 261,000 jobs were added in October, and the unemployment rate rose to 3.7% in October from 3.5% in September.

As mentioned in my previous post, my experience during the dotcom bust in 2000-2002 was eye opening. Hence, I take risks very seriously. Although my liquid portfolio took a 30% hit this year, I am not in any kind of financial distress and I am still able to keep pace with my early stage investments. I want to share some thoughts on how I bulletproof my finances after receiving a windfall. \nWhen Facebook IPO lockup expired, the first thing I did was to sell enough to have a pile of freedom money. I put this money into a separate account and diversified them into a 60/40 index fund portfolio. I only allowed my family to withdraw dividend and interest income from this portfolio and I make sure we live below our means by spending less than this income. I also bought an umbrella insurance policy that will cover up to $5M in case of catastrophe. I have a PAL(Pledged Asset Line) line against this portfolio but I only use it for cash flow management. I usually do not carry any balance on it. \nFor most people, a windfall is typically not large enough to build a pile that offers financial independence. I would suggest that people keep adding to this pile until the amount is large enough to provide financial independence. I don\u2019t recommend people buying or owning any individual stocks/cryptos before this pile is built. It\u2019s simply too risky and not worth the time and stress. \nAfter the pile of freedom money was built, I still had some amount left and I considered it the play money. I decided I could do whatever I want with the play money as long as I don\u2019t end up having a negative balance that eats into the freedom money. I still have a good amount of the play money that I plan to use to invest in early stage companies and real estate. I never take on debt and it\u2019s very hard to be wiped out without debt. \nSomeone asked me if he should sell his META 0.00 stock since he has margin loans against the stock and he is getting margin calls. If he wants to keep the stock, he has to move more money into the account. I told him that he needs to plan for the worst. Namely, stay above water in case of the stock going to zero. There\u2019s no point in guessing the bottom of a stock. Nobody knows the future. People should just make sure they could survive the worst case scenario and the worst case scenario of a single stock is that it drops to 0. \nBorrowing against a single stock is extremely risky. But people have been doing it in the past decade without issues as the underlying stock kept going up. But suddenly, the climate turned. Interest rates went up, stocks crashed and people got liquidated overnight. If they still have the freedom money intact, most likely they are going to be fine. \nBut I am very shocked that many people who received large windfalls didn\u2019t put aside the freedom money. Usually, the rationale is that they don\u2019t want to pay tax and they believe in the company. People end up borrowing against the single stock for big purchases and personal expenses and they get used to it. When the stock started to fall, most people couldn\u2019t get themselves to sell the stock at a lower price and were eventually wiped out. To be frank, I think such behavior is basically gambling. I am not suggesting that people should stop gambling. But people should set aside the freedom money and only gamble on the money they could lose.

Q3 revenue actually beat expectation but the metaverse bet incurred $3.7B of loss in Q3, or ~$15B annualized. Furthermore, Zuck said the metaverse loss will further accelerate in 2023 but they will eventually become profitable in 2030s. Investors are frustrated with this level of spending. But since Meta is a corporate dictatorship, there\u2019s nothing investors could do except for bailing on the stock and that\u2019s exactly what they did. Meta is now trading below $100, a level we haven\u2019t seen since 2016. \nCould Meta\u2019s metaverse ever work? This is a hot topic among my ex-FB friends this past week. I worked at Facebook from 2006 to 2011 as one of the founding engineers of Facebook Ads. I had a blast there and made many life-long friends. But this pivot to metaverse got people confused and my former co-workers are quite divided on this pivot. Some people think Zuck has taken the company through multiple crises and he could make this work. Some people think the premature all-in bet without mass consumer adoption is extremely risky and unlikely to work. \nI personally think investing in the metaverse is fine. It\u2019s a matter of ROI. I created a spreadsheet to see what it takes to make the metaverse bet a success. As illustrated above, with the current spending plan, Meta\u2019s metaverse will have to generate ~$20B of profits for 10+ years to make the IRR 9%, which is not a very high return. $20B is a lot. To give some context, Disney, Nintendo, Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts and Take Two generate ~$20B of annual EBITA combined. With Meta\u2019s current spending plan, a moderately successful metaverse investment has an extremely high bar to clear. SPY 0.00\u2019s long term return is slightly higher than 9%. In other words, instead of spending close to $100B of money on metaverse, if Meta put the money into an index fund, it\u2019s very likely the index fund approach will beat metaverse in turns of investment returns. Sure, the tens of billions plowing into VR/AR could advance humanity in addition to investment returns. But that\u2019s not what most retail investors are looking for. We are also assuming Meta\u2019s metaverse investment turns out to be a huge success here. What if it doesn\u2019t? \nI believe two things triggered investors\u2019 harsh reactions. First, the level of spending is too aggressive. It\u2019s hard to make sense of it if we try to model it financially. Second, although Zuck has voting control, the money he is spending doesn\u2019t belong to him. It belongs to all the shareholders. But he shows no regard for the shareholders and the board is not pushing back on him. The only thing investors can do is to run away from the stock. I do not blame META 0.00 shareholders for running away. He even made Jim Cramer cry. \nSomeone asked me what I would do if I were in charge of Meta. First, I would not have let the Apple relationship slide so far down. When Apple asked for a share of Facebook\u2019s ad revenue, I would have given that to them and figured out a plan to be less dependent in the long run.  Apple privacy changes probably wouldn\u2019t have been made if Facebook had paid up. Apple started advocating the privacy updates as a PR campaign.  Google is paying Apple $15B in 2021 alone (almost 6% of their revenue) to be their default search engine. That's an insane amount of money borderline extortion but it\u2019s a smart business decision. The alternative would have cost Google way more than $15B a year. In the meantime, Google is building out Android, Chrome and bought the phone division of HTC to rival Apple. Look, Apple and Google are direct competitors on smart phones but they figure out a way to work together. But here we are. Facebook got itself into a really bad situation by ignoring Apple. If I were in charge today, my top priority would be to mend relationships with Apple by paying them some money in exchange for much better ad signals and a less prominent \u201cAsk App Not To Track\u201d button. I am sure the ransom paid to Apple will have a very positive ROI. \nIn the meantime, I will keep investing in metaverse but instead of losing $10B a year, I will lose up to a couple of billions a year or less based on consumer adoption. Hardware+OS+Ecosystem takes a long time and many iterations to mature. Since I just bought time from Apple, I can afford to be patient. There are many other things I want to do but if I were in charge, mending relationships with Apple and cutting investments on metaverse will be my top two priorities.\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"title": "10/28/2022: Elon Officially Owns Twitter", "post_id": "81258830.10282022-elon-officially-owns-twitter", "subtitle": "CEO and CFO were fired swiftly ", "content": " \n \nWOW!

Both missed some expectations. Apple beat on revenue and EPS and recorded record revenue and profits. But its iPhone sales and service revenue missed expectations. Amazon missed on revenue and AWS sales but its EPS beat expectations. Apple said the iPhone Pro demand remains strong and has not been affected by the macro environment yet.  But they are currently constrained by supply chain issues. AAPL 0.00 stock price is stable(!!!)  after the report. On the other hand, AMZN 0.00 stock crashed more than 10% after the report because their guided fourth quarter revenue of $140B-$144B is well below analysts\u2019 expectation of $155B, citing changes in the macro environment. \nIt is quite interesting to see the two biggest consumer tech brands\u2019 paths diverge. I suppose everyone uses Amazon to buy everything so its business trends reflect the current macro environment well while Apple is primarily selling premium products. Their target customers are richer and their spending is less affected by inflation or recession. I do wonder if Apple\u2019s product demand will remain strong if we see a deep recession in 2023. \nOverall, the big tech earnings for Q3 were not great. Everyone at least missed something and everyone\u2019s stock tanked except for Apple. Microsoft, Google, Meta, Amazon were all seeing huge gap downs on their stock prices this past week. Interestingly, SPY 0.00 didn\u2019t move down with them. SPY 0.00 was actually up 1.8% this past week. These 5 companies represent more than 20% of SPY\u2019s index weight.

", "content": "META 0.00 reported Q3 earnings after market close today. It was actually better than I though. Revenue only dropped 4% YoY, beating analyst expectations. But net income dropped 52% and free cash flow went down to $173M, a 98% drop YoY. In zuck\u2019s post earnings announcement, he told us Meta will continue to spend like crazy for the next 15 months and they might step on the brakes after that. Investors are not happy about this spending plan and stocked tanked 15+% after the announcement. \nI am pleasantly surprised by their revenue numbers. It only dropped 4% YoY. It seems like messenger ads helped and it\u2019s already a $9B ARR business across WhatsApp and Messenger. But CPM dropped 18% while ad impressions increased by 17%. I wonder if the ad impression increase is sustainable. They could make the revenue look good by serving more ads but they can only increase their ad load to a limited extent before users revolt. It\u2019s a short term fix and they probably can\u2019t keep pulling the same trick after a couple of quarters. \nIt seemed like people are mostly turned off by the expenses. The operating expenses increased by 19% and CAPEX is growing at a crazy 100% rate YoY. With the revenue drop, there isn\u2019t a lot of justification or even rationalization of the expenses. I understand it\u2019s important to invest into certain critical areas like AI, metaverse and the Tik Tok clone. But I hope they can give more clarity on why they choose to lose $3.67B on metaverse this quarter and to spend $9B on CAPEX. Why $3.67B and $9B? Why not $1B and $3B or $2B and $5B? Google\u2019s Cloud Division is only losing $699M this quarter but its revenue grew 37% YoY so the loss seems justifiable as they are developing the cloud platform and acquiring customers. Google\u2019s CAPEX is only ~$7B this quarter and their AI is probably better than Meta\u2019s and Google\u2019s revenue is more than 2X of Meta.  How does Meta justify the aggressive CAPEX spending? Did I mention that the Facebook app is full of bugs and my friends whose accounts got hacked cannot get their accounts back? It\u2019s apparent they are not spending a lot of money on making Facebook product experience better. At least I don\u2019t feel it as a user. \nUltimately, the question is how Meta links spending to results. I am an early stage investor. Companies I invest in don\u2019t spend hundreds of millions in funding until they can reasonably project the outcome. Sure, there are investors who will pour in a lot of money at the R&D or premature scaling stage but those bets mostly went bust such as Magic Leap or Iridium Phones. There are huge successes like SpaceX. But SpaceX\u2019s funding to date is about $10B and they already dominate the rocket launching market with billions of dollars of annual revenue. In comparison, here we are seeing Meta spending $10B+ a year on metaverse with a vague idea that it\u2019s going to be a great business at some point and people will love Meta\u2019s products more than their competitors\u2019. Meta ended up having to have a PR team to defend this long-term game changing metaverse investment, which tells you how little justification they really have. I hope this metaverse thing works out but I have serious doubts.\u00a0"}, {"title": "10/25/2022: Google Q3 Earnings Signified a Slowdown in Digital Ad Spending", "post_id": "80666942.10252022-google-q3-earnings-signified", "subtitle": "Google Missed Q3 revenue and profit expectations", "content": " \n \nGoogle reported Q3 earnings after market close today. It was quite a big miss. Q3 revenue is $69.09B vs. $70.58B expected. EPS is $1.06 vs. $1.25 expected. YouTube advertising revenue is $7.07B vs. $7.42B expected . Youtube revenue actually dropped 2% YoY, which is the first time this ever happened since Alphabet started reporting Youtube revenue separately in their earnings reports. Google Cloud is $6.9 billion vs. $6.69 billion expected. Google Cloud revenue grew 37.5% YoY, which is quite impressive given the current environment. \nTheoretically, Google *missed* their revenue and profit expectations. But I am not surprised at all. People have been talking about this digital ad slowdown for quite a while. Sure, the Apple privacy changes crippled personalized advertising. But search ads are mostly query based, which is quite resilient to the Apple changes. Their Q3 search revenue only grew 4% YoY. In comparison, Q2 revenue grew 13.5% YoY and Q1 revenue grew 24% YoY. I believe we are seeing a general slowdown in digital advertising. The digital ad market grew dramatically during the pandemic. That level of growth is probably not sustainable in the long run. It\u2019s\u00a0 time to reset the growth expectations. Google still has a phenomenal high-margin $200B+ a year business. I believe\u00a0 it will be great to use this lower-growth period to make the company more efficient. \nIt\u2019s worth noting that YouTube ad revenue for Q3 dropped 2% YoY. YouTube revenue was still growing around 5% in Q2. This makes me worry about Meta\u2019s earnings tomorrow. Meta already saw a YoY drop in revenue in Q2 this year. Again, I think a 10+% YoY revenue decline is quite likely but analysts are currently predicting a 5.6% decline. Chances are Meta is going to miss earnings tomorrow. It would be interesting to see how the market reacts to the bad news that everyone already knows.\u00a0 \n"}, {"title": "10/24/2022: Q3 Early Stage Investing Activity Declined Further", "post_id": "80456084.10242022-q3-earning-stage-investing", "subtitle": "Both activity rate and positive activity rate declined", "content": " \n \nAngelList just published their\u00a0State of U.S. Early-Stage Venture & Startups Report\u00a0for Q3 2022. Unsurprisingly, we are seeing QoQ decline in activities and markup rates. Anecdotally, I have observed a general cooling of the early stage funding environment in the past few months. Investors can finally take time to get to know the founders and do proper due diligence before wiring out the money. Unlike last year, many investors were actually taking some time off during summer. In summary, the FOMO environment is over. Pendulum has swung and we are currently in a buyers\u2019 market.  \nAngelList is the largest early stage funding platform of the world. The report is based on the 9,934 seasoned startup investments on the platform entering into Q3 2022. As you may know, startup investments take a very long time (5-10+ years) to become liquid, a proxy metric people often use to measure the performance of a startup portfolio is the followup funding rate: the percentage of startups that raise additional funding or take an exit after the previous funding has seasoned (typically after 12-18 months). \nAccording to the report, the followup funding rate was 7.4% for Q3 2022 vs. 9.3% for Q2 2022 and 11.6% for Q1 2022, another 20% QoQ decline. Among the startups that received followup funding, 63.4% was positive in Q3 2022, meaning the startup saw its share price increase.  The positive rate for Q2 2022 is 77.5% and is  83% for Q1 2022, a 14 percentage points decline QoQ vs 5.3 percentage points decline in the previous quarter.   \n \n \nValuations declined across the board. Pre-seed valuations declined by 19.4% to $10.2M, seed-stage valuations declined by 15.9% to $28M, Series A valuations declined by 13.1% to $86.6M, and Series B valuations declined by 28% to $301M.But compare to Q3 2021, valuations actually rose for seed and series A and only declined marginally for Pre-Seed and Series B. I believe we are not done with the correction on the valuations yet. We are probably going to see more markdowns, shutdowns and recapitalizations next year when startups who raised in 2021 start to run out of money. \n2021 increasingly looks more like an anomaly for early stage funding. I do think it\u2019s healthy to go back to the more normal funding environment pre-pandemic where both founders and investors are level-headed. But with the zero-interest rate environment going away, I do worry the appetite for risky investments like angel investing might decrease sharply. I am committed to keeping pace with my investments through this down cycle. I am hopeful that great companies will be built in a tougher environment as constraints and scarcity make people more resourceful and more committed.\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"title": "10/21/2022: UK Prime Minister Resigned After 44 Days ", "post_id": "79869577.10212022-uk-prime-minister-resigned", "subtitle": "Her unfunded tax cuts were the downfall.

This time $115M is lost. Technically speaking, it\u2019s not really a hack. The hacker is playing by the rules and turned $5M into $100M+. This hack happened because there are some critical design flaws for Mango Markets. Someone actually brought up the vulnerability about 6 months ago but the Mango team didn\u2019t do anything about it. I have difficulty seeing the Mango team bouncing back from this incident as their recklessness is to blame for this unfortunate outcome. \n \nIn summary, the hacker deposited ~$5M of USDC into Mango and took a huge MNGO-PERP long position. After that, he was able to manipulate MNGO token\u2019s price from $0.03 to $0.91 as MNGO is a thinly traded low liquidity s**tcoin, resulting in a huge ~$400M+ unrealized capital gain. He then borrowed $115M against this unrealized capital gain, effectively draining all liquidity out of Mango. \nAfter the hacker withdrew all the tokens out of Mango, he submitted the following proposal to Mango Dao, titled Repay bad debt. \nhi all, the mango treasury has about 70M USDC available to repay bad debt. \nI propose the following. If this proposal passes, I will send the MSOL, SOL, and MNGO in this account to an address announced by the mango team. The mango treasury will be used to cover any remaining bad debt in the protocol, and all users without bad debt will be made whole. Any bad debt will be viewed as a bug bounty / insurance, paid out of the mango insurance fund. By voting for this proposal, mango token holders agree to pay this bounty and pay off the bad debt with the treasury, and waive any potential claims against accounts with bad debt, and will not pursue any criminal investigations or freezing of funds once the tokens are sent back as described above. \nWOW! That\u2019s some bold proposal. The hacker is not admitting any wrongdoing and is seeing this as a bug bounty. It\u2019s a bit weird but after thinking it through, I actually agree with his assessment. Sure, the $50M+ bounty is a bit excessive. But Mango has two critical design flaws that enable this hack. First, They allow uncapped borrowing against unrealized gains on thinly traded and easily price manipulated s**tcoins. Second, they allow cross collaterals. The combination of the two makes it a recipe for disaster. It\u2019s basically begging for North Korea hackers to fake some gains and drain all liquidity out by borrowing against the fake gains. Mango should feel lucky they are attacked by an independent hacker and have some hope to get the money back. \nThe hacker was later doxxed as he actually deposited the USDC from FTX and later also manipulated the MNGO price on FTX. Thanks to the KYC law, all the customers on FTX have to go through the identity verification process. As mentioned above, I don\u2019t know if he actually broke the law. He did what Mango allows their users to do.  Maybe this is why he is funding his wallet through FTX as he doesn\u2019t think what he is doing is a hack.  Mango\u2019s terrible design flaws are to blame here. I hope they work out a solution so that the hacker earns a decent bug bounty and all the mango users are made whole. \nI can\u2019t believe these crazy hacks keep happening in crypto but here is our $100M+ hack of the week. I hope we don\u2019t see another one in the next few days!!  \nUpdate 10/14/2022:  A new DAO proposal proposed by the Mango team is up and is being approved. It looks like the depositors will be made whole. The bug bounty is an insanely high ~$50M though.   \nUpdate 10/15/2022: The hacker has spoken, charactering the Mango incident as a highly profitable trading strategy.

", "content": "According to a WSJ report, John Foley, the co-founder and former chief executive of Peloton faced repeated margin calls on money he borrowed against his Peloton holdings before he left the fitness company\u2019s board last month. Peloton\u2019s stock peaked in December 2020 at $160+ and is now trading around $9 today, an almost 95% drop. \nIn recent years, under the low interest rate environment, many people have used margin loans to finance large purchases or to make more investments. On paper, it\u2019s a great idea. People can avoid paying taxes, keep control of their company and still buy all the shiny toys they want. They can also make their money work harder for them by leveraging up. But if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Things start to crumble when interest rates start to go up as rising interest rates put pressure on asset prices. And in the case of 2022, skyrocketing interest rates basically burst the asset bubbles. \nPeople with margin loan balances are now facing a double whammy of high interest payments and a crashing net worth as the twice leveraged portfolio is crashing twice as hard. In the case of Peloton, their current stock price of $9 is not only a fraction of their peak price of $160 but is also way below their IPO price of $29 a share. In retrospect, having margin loans on volatile IPO stocks is a really bad idea. I personally know a good number of people who did not adequately diversify in the past few years and didn\u2019t feel any danger until 2022. For them, it\u2019s hard to take profits and pay taxes but it\u2019s even harder to take losses and start anew. Their brokers might eventually do that for them and they are going to be wiped out. This really feels like a replay of 2000-2002. I was a junior engineer at Yahoo! (Yahoo! stock went down 95% during the period.) The stories I heard were almost exact parallels to what I am hearing today: Irrational exuberance and rampant speculation followed by margin calls, austerity and regrets. This time if the story follows what I have experienced in 2000-2002, things are probably going to get worse from here. \nMy portfolio crashed 80% back in 2000-2002. It turned out to be one of the best things that have ever happened to me. It taught me a great lesson of risk when I only had a 5-figure net worth. Things can really go down 80%, 90% or 100% and never come back up!! Seeing so many tech people losing so much money around me was gut wrenching. My main takeaway there was to not take risks for the money I don\u2019t need and to not dwell on the past over the lost fortune. Losing money is not a big deal as long as people don\u2019t lose their spirit. I believe 2022 will turn out to be a great year for many people in retrospect as going through the storms makes us stronger and wiser.

Ukrainian people suffer greatly from it. The rest of the world hates it. It brought an energy crisis, food shortage and now the nuclear threat!!

The US economy added 263,000 in September vs. 315,000 jobs added in August , and the unemployment rate edged down to 3.5 % from 3.7% in August. Notable job gains occurred in leisure and hospitality and in health care. Average hourly earnings for all employees in the private sector rose by $0.1, or 0.3%, to $32.46. Average hourly earnings have increased by 5.0% YoY. In September, average hourly earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees rose by $0.1 , or 0.4% to $27.77. \n \nThe Stock market crashed after the report was out with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 650 points. This is a pretty good job report. Sure, job growth slowed down a bit but the unemployment rate edges down and wages are still going up. I believe the market actually doesn\u2019t want a good job report right now. A good job report will propel the Fed to keep raising interest rates as the real worry is about inflation. The fact that wages are going up at a pace that\u2019s still far higher than the target 2% inflation is worrisome. This indicates that demand for labor outpaces supply. As mentioned in the job report, the labor force participation rate was little changed at 62.3 percent in September, and the employment-population ratio was unchanged at 60.1 percent. Both measures are 1.1 percentage points below their values in February 2020. \nIt looks like the US economy has a structural issue of labor participation post pandemic. Instead of having the Fed raising rates to a level that dramatically lowers demand for labor, we shall probably come up with some other solutions such as easier immigration or child care assistance to address labor shortage. I wouldn\u2019t bet on things being changed and implemented so quickly on the policy side though. We are most likely going to see the Fed raising rates to more than 4% by the end of the year.\u00a0 \n \n"}, {"title": "10/6/2022: $500M+ was Stolen on BSC", "post_id": "76878342.1062022-500m-was-stolen-on-bsc", "subtitle": "Hacker stole 2M BNB tokens from the BSC Token Hub", "content": " \nToday was a very calm and light news day. I was about to write a boring story about Costco\u2019s impressive September sales and waited for tomorrow\u2019s job report. When I was about to fall asleep at my desk writing about Costco, some crazy crypto news happened!! About 3 hours ago, BSC (Binance Smart Chain) halted their chain. Apparently, 2M BNB tokens (or ~$550M USD) were stolen from BSC Token hub through some cross chain minting mechanism. At first, people were very confused why a crypto whale is acting crazy by swapping out and borrowing an insane amount of money on the BSC chain. But apparently this one day old crypto whale stole 2M BNB through a clever hack. I don\u2019t fully understand the whole mechanism as it\u2019s quite technical but this twitter thread explains how this hacker was able to trick the BSC Token hub to send them 2M BNB. It sounded like the hacker was able to fake a proof of deposit and withdraw the funds from the token hub. \n \nThe BSC chain is now halted due to this $500M hack. The hacker\u2019s wallet address has been blacklisted by USDT. As illustrated above, about $100M of funds are bridged over to other chains. I suppose we can assume that $100M is lost. It does sound like the Binance team /BSC chain might do something to prevent the hacker from transferring out the remaining $440M dollars on BSC though. It would be interesting to see how they deal with the aftermath of this hack once the BSC chain resumes operations. Personally, I think the scariest part of this hack is that people assume the math and cryptography work flawlessly. The reason we trust decentralization is because we can rely on these impressive cryptographic algorithms. But what if it turns out to be a false promise. If there\u2019s another leap of computational power, our private keys could be broken. Right now we are already seeing smart hackers accessing other people\u2019s wallets or in this case faking proof of deposits. Without any centralized authority to punish bad behavior, crypto users need to shoulder all the risks themselves. I am not sure if most crypto users are\u00a0 aware or ready for that level of risk taking . This is not something most crypto influencers talk about when they try to shill their coins.

Ripple\u2019s XRP token was blatantly shilled on the Ellen DeGeneres show. I found that to be quite distasteful. Supposedly, the government is going to rule which cryptos are securities and which cryptos are currencies soon. But presently many bad actors are taking advantage of this ambiguity and blatantly shill various sh**coins to enrich themselves based on the false promise that these coins will make buyers rich.

The electric-vehicle maker delivered a record 343,830 vehicles to customers in the three months to September. But the Wall Street forecasts are expecting deliveries to be between 358,000 and 371,000 vehicles. There was also a larger-than-usual gap between production and delivery numbers. The company produced 365,923 vehicles in the third quarter. In other words, they didn\u2019t sell out all their cars like the previous quarters. \nIn late August, I took delivery of a new model X, which was backlogged for a long time and I didn\u2019t expect it to be available until January 2023. But I was suddenly able to get the delivery immediately if I was willing to upgrade to the more pricey Plaid version. I took the bait but it\u2019s indicative of the waning demand of Teslas. As usual, there were some cosmetic problems with my new X and the issues are still not fully addressed. For a $130K vehicle, it\u2019s kind of insane that I have to deal with all the problems. The driving experience is superb if I could overlook the issues such as the bruised leather or the misfit window shield. Their service work is also sloppy as they made the car super dirty after my first repair appointment and there\u2019s not a phone number I could call to complain about it. I believe Tesla still has the lead for electric cars but with all the hardware and customer service issues, I wonder how many customers are willing to put up with this. \nWith the rising interest rates, it\u2019s inevitable the demand for new cars will slow down. I have always thought Tesla stock is overvalued. Even with today\u2019s drop, TSLA\u2018s Enterprise Value/EBITA is 50+, which is insanely high. They are going to have their earnings in mid-October and the Elon vs. Twitter lawsuit will also happen in the same week. It\u2019s quite likely their stock will fall further. In my opinion, TSLA 0.00 is the ultimate meme stock.

I am not sure I agree with them. First, they are super biased. Cathie Wood and Jeremy Siegel are equity fund managers who want to have low interest rates to keep equity prices inflated. Elon Musk is selling cars that a high interest rate on auto loans would dampen consumer demand. Their argument is that there\u2019s a lot of unsold inventory and the strong US dollar will make the imported goods cheaper. But the US is a service based economy and the Core CPI was 0.6% from July to August. The hourly earnings \u00a0increased 0.3% from July to August. This tells us that there\u2019s an upward pressure for wages. Wages are sticky and they don\u2019t tend to go down. The consumer confidence report further confirms potential wage growth. Hence, I don\u2019t believe there will be a deflation. What we should really worry about is the inflation caused by labor shortage and wage increases.

When I started this blog at the end of Q2 this year, I saw the world was entering a new era after a long period of easy money, overinflated asset prices and a less healthy and more remote workforce due to COVID. I knew the next two years could be tough and asset prices most likely would be reset. I wanted to record my thoughts during this period of transition. I believe my predictions turned out to be fairly inline with what actually happened. \nFrankly, the past few months feel like a slow motion train wreck. We know things are getting worse but there\u2019s not much we can do about it because we are simply collectively paying down the debt we accumulated during the easy money / rampant speculation period. The teachable lesson here is that zero interest rate is dangerous for our economy in the long run. Zero-interest rate is like Adderall. Adderall improves people\u2019s focus and attention in the short run but it has some dangerous adverse long term side effects. Our economy was quite addicted to the zero-interest rate. We need to take the bitter medicine of rising interest rates plus recession to treat this addiction. It\u2019s going to be tough but our economy will eventually come out more healthy and resilient.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"title": "9/22/2022: Another $160M Crypto Hack", "post_id": "74496243.9222022-another-160m-crypto-hack", "subtitle": "Wintermute lost $160M due to a vanity wallet hack ", "content": "Every time I run out of ideas for this blog, I go fishing for some insane story in the crypto world and I never come back empty handed. Here is another mind blowing story that just happened a couple of days ago. \nWintermute, a crypto market maker, has lost $160 million in a hack relating to its decentralized finance (DeFi) operation. It\u2019s quite an interesting story. In a nutshell, their private key was compromised and the hacker transferred the assets out of Wintermute\u2019s vault. A few days prior, someone from 1inch published a blog about how to recover the private key from a vanity address. A vanity address is a cool address which starts with 000000, 111111, 1234567 etc. There are tools people can use to generate these vanity keys with cool addresses but it turns out these keys are a lot less secure and easier to break. For your safety, please never use those tools. \nAfter learning about the vulnerability of the vanity addresses, Wintermute transferred the assets out of the vanity wallet but they forgot to transfer assets out of the contracts the vanity key controlled. (WTF?!) $160M is now gone. Just a few months ago, Wintermute sent 20M OP tokens to an account that they didn\u2019t control. Those tokens are later returned but it doesn\u2019t appear they are getting their funds back this time. \nThink about it. $160M is a crazy amount of money. But in Wintermute\u2019s setup, one single private key can move that amount of money around and they lost it all. It boggles my mind that they don\u2019t have a tighter process to at least minimize their exposure per private key.\u00a0 Well, I am sure there are a lot of shenanigans happening in the TradFi world. It\u2019s just not as public.

The market reacted quite negatively to the announcement as the Dow dropped 500 points today. It turns out that people were surprised by the Fed Committee\u2019s rate projections in the next couple of years. As illustrated above 17 out of the 19 FOMC members expect the Fed fund rate to be between 4.125-4.375% by the end of the year and 18 out 19 expect the rate to be between 4.375-4.875% in 2023. Just a couple of months ago, the expectation was that the rate would be raised to ~3% and they will start cutting it next year.

My cash can finally earn some interest and asset bubbles can finally deflate. I do still see quite a bit of optimism from my friends who are buying the dip.

It is not a good time to IPO right now as the IPO stocks have been battered this year. Shares of DoorDash, the most comparable company to Instacart in the public market, dropped 60% YTD despite beating their quarterly earning expectations over and over again. According to WSJ, Instacart actually turned a net profit and saw revenue grow 39% from the year-earlier period in the most recent fiscal quarter. \nI suppose the main question on investors\u2019 minds is why Instacart wants to IPO so desperately right now. They are certainly going to IPO at a deep discount to the $39B valuation they fetched in March 2021. I believe there are two main reasons. The first is that the very early employees\u2019 RSUs(restricted stock units) might be expiring. RSU holders are not allowed to sell shares in the private market and the RSUs will expire after a predetermined period, typically 5-7 years. Technically, the company could reissue the RSUs but there will be many legal and tax implications for re-issuance. IPO will be a good solution and this type of semi-forced IPO happened back in 2020 for AirBnB. The second reason is that they want to assure current employees that their stock-based compensation, which is typically a large percentage of the total compensation for startups, is worth something. I think these are legitimate reasons but their public market valuation will probably be hit really hard. \nThe most interesting part of the IPO plan, according to WSJ, is the following: \nWhile Instacart will sell a small percentage of new shares, the bulk of its offering will come from employee shares that will be sold directly to new investors at an agreed-upon price ahead of a stock-market debut. Details of the listing could change depending on market conditions and other factors. \nBasically, instead of waiting for the IPO lockup period to expire, many of the employee shares will be sold at the IPO. This is a big red flag. This plan is telling us that the company is not confident enough that their stock price will hold up for employees to wait for the lockup expiration (typically six months after IPO). In addition, this IPO is going to be a down round. Investors who invested at a higher valuation are going to get more shares due to the downside protection terms in most late stage deals. There is going to be quite a bit of dilution at IPO because of the downside protection and more dilution down the road due to the stock-based compensation. They are using Goldman Sachs to sell the IPO shares. I am an Instacart customer and use them at least two times a week. But they have a difficult business model, fierce competition from DoorDash and based on the signaling for their IPO, I will stay away from owning their shares.\u00a0 \n \n \n"}, {"title": "9/19/2022: Risk Free Return is Now 4%", "post_id": "73991573.9192022-risk-free-return-is-now-4", "subtitle": "Yield for 12-month treasury bill is 4.06%", "content": "After years of low yield on fixed income instruments, we are finally seeing the yield rise enough to make it worth it. As illustrated above (I took the screenshot from Schwab this morning), you can put your money into a 12-month treasury bill and earn a solid 4.06% risk-free return. It doesn\u2019t quite beat inflation but is pretty solid compared to other alternatives. \nWSJ has a whole article talking about this. In short, the super low rates forced people to over index on equity and now people are moving back to fixed-income to match their risk profile better. Author Nassim Taleb is not a big fan of the low interest rate policy and he went pretty far by saying \n\"We've had 15 years, 14 and a half years of Disneyland that basically has destroyed the economic structure. Think about it. No interest rates,\" \nAt zero interest rates \u2026 for long periods of time, you are hurting the economy. You're creating bubbles, creating tumors like bitcoin, creating hedge funds that should not exist but have existed for 15 years \nI believe most economists/policy makers think as long as the inflation rate is low, they keep the interest rates low and there\u2019s no harm. But now we are seeing severe consequences of the overinflated asset prices due to low interest rates. When the overinflated asset prices come crashing down, it dramatically reduces investors\u2019 appetite for risk taking. The over-leveraged are getting liquidated and the over-debted are going broke. I do think this interest rate rising cycle is a good opportunity to reset  expectations about interest rates. I agree the 0% interest rate is not long term sustainable and a long term 3-5% rate is healthier. 3-5% is not too high to obliterate real estate and business investments and not too low to encourage over-leveraging and speculation. I hope the Fed will raise the rate to ~4% and keep it there for a few years. It would take some adjustment but it will be better for the long run.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"title": "9/16/2022: FedEx Warns", "post_id": "73663002.9162022-fedex-warns", "subtitle": "The most recent quarter's numbers are well below expectations.

As a result of the preliminary first quarter financial performance and expectations for a continued volatile operating environment, FedEx is withdrawing its fiscal year 2023 earnings forecast provided on June 23, 2022.

Also according to PitchBook, seed investors paid $0.08 per share back in 2013 and series A investors paid $0.2 per share back in 2015. The acquisition is allegedly priced at ~$20B. Let\u2019s say Adobe paid $40 per share. This means the seed investors 500X\u2019ed their money and series A investors 200X\u2019es their money. Congratulations to Index Ventures (Seed Lead Investor) and Greylock (Lead Series A investor) for making the great pick early and helping Figma become the ubiquitous tool for web design. All the designers I worked with use Figma and many designer turned investors invested in Figma. I am so happy for them. \nThis is one of the main reasons I love investing in startups. No, it\u2019s not about 500X or 200X the original investment. It\u2019s about changing the world. The investment return is a measurement of how much the world has been changed due to a particular startup. Most startup founders try super hard to change the world but ultimately fail. Some do make it work and have a vibrant business. But occasionally, we see a unicorn like Figma that creates a new category or transforms a profession or an industry. If I were to be completely honest, a lot of times it\u2019s hard to tell in the beginning. But I do notice that having great people in the founding team is a necessary condition (but not a sufficient condition) for great successes. \nI have invested in a handful of unicorns. All the unicorns I have invested so far have pretty unique founders. I can even tell you who will become unicorns in the next few years if they have reached the product market fit. My observation has been that they are resourceful, high energy, great at execution and are inspiring in their own unique way. As an investor, I don\u2019t aspire to have insights for all the industries (but it is a personal passion of mine to understand how the world works).

CommonBond decided to pivot to solar financing earlier this year in response to the student loan policy. The solar financing business is growing well but they are not able to secure new capital to keep scaling their business to profitability.

In 2022, things started to crack and in the past three months, there are really not a lot of deals going on. AFAIK, most venture capitalists were taking August off and many GPs are not calling capital for the rest of the year. For companies that raised a lot of money in 2021 and spent most of the raised money, they are due for a rude awakening. At the moment, startups need amazing progress to raise a new round and if they do secure a round, they are raising at a deep discount compared to the valuations we were seeing last year. \nAs for what happened to companies who couldn\u2019t raise a new round, I believe most of them will try hard to stay alive by cutting costs. Some of them will manage to survive and may eventually thrive. But most of them will close down or be sold for scraps. Startups are not for the faint of the heart.

Although their cash flow is good, their stock-based compensation expense is quite high: ~$140 million in the most recent quarter or 22.3% of their quarterly revenue. Their operating margin is actually negative if stock-based compensation is accounted for. High stock-based compensation becomes a big problem when the growth stalls. Stock-based compensation has always been a bit controversial because shareholders are being diluted. But the justification has always been that the company can keep more cash for growth and expansion. When growth disappears, stock-based compensation becomes unjustifiable and investors will stop buying into the Non-GAAP operating margin any more. We are seeing many (formerly) high-growth companies facing this issue as shown above and their stocks have been hit hard for good reasons. \nDocuSign is still looking for a new CEO after the previous CEO resigned in June.

If PG&E tells me my electricity bill is going to 10X next year, I would go insane and the government probably would intervene.

Most of the stable coin volume on Binance is on USDT, BUSD and USDC. The other two stable coins mentioned in the press release have very thin volume. This move will increase BUSD\u2019s trading volume by at least 10% by absorbing USDC volume. It\u2019s pretty obvious that Binance wants to promote its own stable coin and demote USDC.

I wonder if Binance\u2019s long term plan is to pull away from USDT as USDT is potentially insolvent and it\u2019s playing with fire by going against the OFAC. If Binance can shift most of the trading volume into BUSD, they might be able to cancel USDT eventually. By disassociating with USDT, I believe it will help legitimize Binance.

I can\u2019t believe I kept the pace of making five posts a week since July 4th. I truly enjoy writing this blog. There were a lot of events worth recording during this period. Writing helps me clarify my thoughts and form opinions on various topics. I plan to keep it up for the foreseeable future. \nThe August Job Report is out. 315,000 jobs were added while the unemployment rate went up 0.2 percentage point to 3.7%. The labor force participation rate increased by 0.3 percentage point over the month to 62.4% but is 1.0 percentage point below its February 2020 level. The employment-population ratio was little changed at 60.1% in August and remains 1.1 percentage points below its February 2020 value. \nCompared to July\u2019s 526,000 jobs added and 3.5% unemployment rate, the August report is not as good as July but the labor market remains strong. Average hourly earnings went up 0.3% from July to August vs. 0.5% from June to July. This slowdown in wage growth is precisely what the Fed is looking for to tamper inflation. \nAccording to the report, the number of persons not in the labor force who currently want a job declined by 361,000 to 5.5 million in August. This measure remains above its February 2020 level of 5.0 million. These individuals were not counted as unemployed because they were not actively looking for work during the 4 weeks preceding the survey or were unavailable to take a job. This is a pretty big drop and a welcoming sign of more people wanting to go back to work. \nAlso according to the report, 6.5 percent of employed persons teleworked because of the coronavirus pandemic, down from 7.1 percent in the prior month. People are going back to the offices. I work in a co-working space and I am definitely seeing a lot more people in the office recently. Companies like Goldman Sachs are said to be done with the pandemic and order all of their employees back to offices 5 days a week after the labor day. As far as I know most employees want the flexibility of remote work but some employers have strong concerns on how remote work affects company culture, employee loyalty and long term productivity. I can see both sides of the argument. It would be really interesting to see how the remote work trend evolves in the next few years. I personally think companies who can manage the cultural aspect of remote work well will be the ultimate winners.\u00a0\u00a0 \n  \n \n"}, {"title": "9/1/2022: Okta Crashed 33.7% after Earnings ", "post_id": "71423925.912022-okta-crashed-337-after-earnings", "subtitle": "Results beat expectations but its stock price tumbled", "content": " \nOkta reported earnings for the quarter ending July 31, 2022. Quarterly revenue grew 43% year-over-year; subscription revenue grew 44% year-over-year. Overall, it\u2019s a very strong quarter but the stock crashed 33.7%. There appears to be some issues with the Auth0 integration. The management saw a higher attrition rate and some confusion of the integration on the field. Management noted that they are working to slow attrition, including making changes to their org structure to better align with their strategy as well as improving sales comp structures. \nI think Okta is a company with a pretty strong moat and their product is super sticky. Their main product is the single sign-on software most medium- to large-size companies need to manage employee access on cloud software. I believe they are the biggest player in the access management field and I think it\u2019s not a bad stock to own with the right place. \nAfter the crash, Okta\u2019s enterprise value is less than $10B now. With $1.8B projected revenue for FY 2023 (ending Jan 31, 2023), their P/S ratio is 5.55, which is lower than the long term average of public SaaS companies of 8. Their gross margin is 75+%. Their revenue growth rate + cash flow margin is 44% + (-4%) = 40%, which meets the criterion of rule of 40 exactly. Sure, they have some short term integration issues. But well, it\u2019s short term. They are selling software that\u2019s essential, uncontroversial, high margin and low competition. I am not really in the market to buy more stocks at the moment. But I think now is a good time to buy OKTA 0.00. People rushed to buy OKTA 0.00 when it was super expensive at $200+ last year but now no one wants it at a super cheap price of $60.

SPY is down 5.8% in the past 4 trading days and down 4.2% for August. \nMost economic indicators are actually not bad. The energy price is coming down (in the USA). Job markets remain very strong. July inflation numbers are good. Q2 earnings reports are generally better than expected. The main concern is that the Fed is going to raise interest rates higher and keep it there to tamper inflation. \nPersonally, I am not too worried about it. The reality is that the stock indices have come down more than 20%. Historically, if people were investing at 20% discount from the all-time high, their long term return on a broadly diversified portfolio would be alright. If interested, you can check out this tool to see the historical return data. People might argue that all time highs we observed in 2021 were a huge outlier and even a 20% discount would still be too expensive. I don\u2019t disagree with that. But I also think pulling out of equity completely is riskier than having some exposure as investors have to have a strategy to get back into the market to not have their funds being eaten away by inflation. But the study has shown that for investors who missed the 20 best days of the stock market from 1999-2018, their return is essentially negative. Market timing is kind of impossible if I have to ensure my strategy covers the best 20 days out of 20 years.  Instead, it\u2019s a lot easier (and sensible) to continue to sit on my index portfolio and brace for the crazy volatility in the upcoming months.\u00a0"}, {"title": "9/2/2022: A Post-Pandemic Real Estate Hangover? ", "post_id": "71133083.922022-a-post-pandemic-real-estate", "subtitle": "Are laptop landlords in trouble? ", "content": " \n \nAfter a huge increase of real estate prices during the pandemic, many of the Zoom towns are now seeing a massive slowdown in real estate sales. (Note: A Zoom town is a community that experiences a significant population increase as due to an influx of remote workers). Sure, the mortgage rates have increased from <3% last year to >5% recently so the real estate slowdown is universal. But zoom towns are being hit hardest due to the huge increase in prices and a good percentage of remote workers being called back to offices. Plus, some people are moving back to the big cities as they snap back to the action. \nThere\u2019s also a bit of a speculative real estate bubble brewing in these zoom towns, whose home prices are less expensive. As shown in the chart above, Boise and Austin\u2019s median home price went up around 50% from 2019 to 2021. AFAIK, the huge price run is not entirely based on real demand. There were a lot of real estate investors popping up during the pandemic. I personally invested in a real estate fund in late 2020. The fund focuses on buying up single family homes in the third- and fourth- tier cities/suburbs, and then renovating, renting and flipping these houses to make profits. The fund uses a lot of leverage. When the interest rate is low and house prices are increasing, it\u2019s working great. I was able to exit the fund in February this year and made a handsome profit. I don\u2019t know if they still allow redemptions but I imagine things are getting a lot harder as the rate increases and home prices stagnate. \nIn addition to real estate funds, people can now use websites like Roofstock to buy real estate remotely with very little hassle. It seems so easy to be a laptop landlord. All people need to do is to browse the website, select the properties, click, click, click and voil\u00e0, you are a home owner. Roofstock also helps with renting out the homes and when the right time comes, helps sell the homes. All people need to do is to make the initial investment and then it\u2019s cashflow, cashflow and profit. This all sounds great. But like everything in investing, if too many people are doing the same thing, it will bring down the return and eventually people will start losing money. \nThe scariest part of all the real estate speculation is when all the real estate investors stop buying at the same time, we may get into situations tech growth stocks, late stage ventures and cryptos experienced earlier this year. The home prices could crash really hard in areas with high investor activities. But perhaps this is not a bad thing. Investors learn their lessons by losing money and people with actual needs of housing can buy homes at reasonable prices.\u00a0 \n \n  \n \n \n \n"}, {"title": "8/29/2022: Is Censorship Coming for Blockchains? ", "post_id": "70914266.8292022-is-censorship-coming-for", "subtitle": "What is the point of a censored blockchain? ", "content": " \nCrypto prices have been crashing in the past two weeks. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just a coincidence but the 25% crash corresponded with the Tornado Cash ban from the US Treasury. rekt.news had a great article about the implications of this ban. Can the actions of a single powerful government affect the entire network? How much, if any, censorship is acceptable? \nWhen the Tornado Cash ban was first announced, we were seeing front-end screening from DeFi protocols. In fact, my wallet was briefly flagged and I wrote a post complaining really loud to get unblocked (, presumably by TRM labs, whose centralized service assesses and flags*high risk* wallets using AI but is apparently not very good). The crypto community started to realize that blocking the front-end is not enough to assuage the regulators. Regulators are not dumb. What happens if regulators demand the sanctioned addresses being blocked at the blockchain level? Namely, the blockchain miners/validators would ignore proposed transactions that include sanctioned addresses. In fact, the miner/validator level filtering is being implemented by some volunteers. This is a bit scary. Imagine that the USA and EU decide that all the validators/miners physically located under their jurisdiction have to comply with their rules. The anti-censorship features of blockchains would then cease to exist. If the blockchains decide this is not acceptable and move their validators out of the USA and EU, then the question becomes if there would be enough decentralization to make the blockchains function well.  How useful would a blockchain be if a blockchain loses either its anti-censorship or decentralization feature? That is an existential question for the crypto community to think about.  \nNow the US government is banning things that are obviously criminal. But what prevents them from applying regulations to the on-chain world in the future if we keep going down this slippery slope? Will Uniswap be banned because it\u2019s not a registered exchange? Will Aave be banned because it\u2019s not a licensed lender? Will Perpetual Protocol be banned because perpetual contracts are illegal in the US? I am not talking about banning by blocking frontends here. I am talking about banning by blocking at the blockchain level if the validator/miner nodes are physically located in the USA. I personally think it would be the end of the wide adoption of blockchains if regulators are able to push this far.\u00a0 \n \n"}, {"title": "8/30/2022: A Very Cold Winter in Europe?

According to this Guardian article,  if gas prices stay at current levels Vladimir Putin could keep exports to Europe at 20% of normal levels for the next two to three years, and could cut off supplies entirely for a year without adverse effects on the Russian economy.  With the Russian-Ukrainian war raging on, it\u2019s plausible that Russia could retaliate against the Western sanctions by cutting off gas supplies to Europe in the upcoming winter.    \nThe  utility prices have been skyrocketing in Europe. British households were told that their power and gas bills will increase from Oct. 1 by 80%.  One of my contacts in Europe sent me the chart above, showing the electricity tariff at the European Energy Exchange (in \u20ac per MWh).  The price has more than 10x from a year ago. As my contact explained to me, this is the price at which utility and industrial companies purchase electricity, if necessary, often years in advance. Although natural gas is only a fraction of the energy mix the electricity tariffs are bound to the most expensive energy source which is natural gas.  39% of Europe\u2019s natural gas supply is through imports from Russia.  It would be devastating if the supply gets cut off.  \n \nAccording to my friend, the energy crisis is real and everyday people are feeling the impact. Exploding energy cost is the main driver behind the high inflation in Europe  in addition to rising cost for food. The energy crisis is also affecting the global supply chain. European car makers, bottle manufacturers and  skyscraper builders are preparing for a possible glass shortage if the loss of Russian gas throttles production.  \n \nThe USA seems to be in a relatively strong position compared to Europe or China. At least we don\u2019t have a huge immediate crisis like the energy shortage in Europe or the real estate collapse in China. The world is going through a recession now. But chances are the recession/stagflation we are experiencing in the US right now is way milder than what\u2019s happening in Europe or China.  \n"}, {"title": "8/26/2022: Powell Wants to Raise Rates Until Inflation is Under Control", "post_id": "70497303.8262022-powell-wants-to-raise-rates", "subtitle": "Dow falls 1000 points after his remarks.

The president said that he will cancel $10,000 in federal student loan debt for borrowers making under $125,000 a year or couples making less than $250,000 a year. In addition, those who receive federal Pell Grants and make less than $125,000 a year would be eligible for total forgiveness of $20,000.  \nAs mentioned in my previous post, the majority of American people actually supported forgiving ~$10K student loans but are against reliefs that are higher. I believe the Biden Administration strikes a good balance here. The college cost is so out of control and we shouldn\u2019t put all the burdens on the students. But this creates a bit of perverse incentive and is unfair to students who paid off their loans on-time or opted not to go to college due to cost. When asked about fairness, President Biden\u2019s response is:  \n \"Is it fair to people who, in fact, do not own multibillion-dollar businesses if they see one of these guys getting all the tax breaks? Is that fair?\" Biden said. \"What do you think?\" \nWell, it\u2019s a bit of circular logic here. Maybe we should fix the multibillion-dollar businesses tax loophole instead of trying to make it even by introducing other unfair policies? \nPersonally, I am OK with the small $10K relief but I can understand why this sparks such a political outrage. I am a bit disappointed that they are still not doing much to hold the colleges accountable. Here is the section about college accountability in the press release:\u00a0 \nAdditionally, the Department of Education has already taken significant steps to strengthen accountability, so that students are not left with mountains of debt with little payoff. The agency has re-established the enforcement unit in the Office of Federal Student Aid and it is holding accreditors\u2019 feet to the fire. In fact, the Department just withdrew authorization for the accreditor that oversaw schools responsible for some of the worst for-profit scandals. The agency will also propose a rule to hold career programs accountable for leaving their graduates with mountains of debt they cannot repay, a rule the previous Administration repealed.Building off of these efforts, the Department of Education is announcing new actions to hold accountable colleges that have contributed to the student debt crisis. These include publishing an annual watch list of the programs with the worst debt levels in the country, so that students registering for the next academic year can steer clear of programs with poor outcomes. They also include requesting institutional improvement plans from the worst actors that outline how the colleges with the most concerning debt outcomes intend to bring down debt levels.\u00a0 \nBasically, they are cracking down on for-profit colleges and create a shame-list for schools that have high tuition and low income prospects. I don\u2019t think this is nearly enough. If the colleges have any shame, the student loan crisis would have never snowballed to such insane levels today. Instead, they should really align the incentives of the students and the colleges by asking colleges to hold the student loans on their balance sheet. The government can supply them with low-interest rate loans so that colleges can underwrite the loans themselves. The government can then grant the colleges a good amount of loss reserve annually to absorb loan defaults at a reasonable level. This way colleges have strong incentives to keep their tuition low and only give out loans students can afford to repay.  There are already government programs with similar mechanisms like the CDFI fund.  I don\u2019t believe colleges will change their behavior much with the current Biden plan. More needs to be done.  \nAlso, they extend the loan forbearance for another 4 months until the end of the year because the federal government is not ready to resume student loan payment processing yet(!!!???). I suppose consumer spending will remain strong in the next few months.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"title": "8/24/2022: Twitter Drama Has a New Twist", "post_id": "70082210.8242022-twitter-drama-has-a-new-twist", "subtitle": "Ex-head of Security said Twitter is lying about bots to Elon Musk. ", "content": " \n  \nTwitter\u2019s ex-head of security, Peiter \u201cMudge'' Zatko, filed a whistleblower complaint, alleging egregious security deficiencies. You can read the whole (redacted) complaint here. It\u2019s quite an interesting and informative read, telling us how sausage gets made at Twitter and frankly it\u2019s quite consistent with my experience during the early days of Facebook. People thought these platforms have a flawless system and a very precise process of problem solving, software deployment and internal controls. It can not be more far away from reality. Basically, Mudge was hired by Jack Dorsey to fix the security deficiencies after a 17-year old hacked into President Obama and many other public figures\u2019 Twitter accounts in 2020. He tried very hard to do his job but was facing an uphill battle because allegedly the executive team just wanted to shove various security and spam problems under the rug. A few months after he accepted the job, he presented his findings to the executive team and let me just quote the whole thing from the report:\u00a0 \n \n49. Initial Report: Mudge presented his initial findings to the senior executive team in February 2021, about one week before the Q1 Board meeting.\u201d Jack Dorsey had \u2018specifically recruited Mudge for his reputation of speaking truth to power, and told Mudge to not hold back. And Twitter's other senior leaders knew they had security problems. But even so, the rest of the executives were stunned to hear Mudge tell them just how bad things were. While Mudge highlighted some positive aspects of Twitter's security processes, such as the Company's well exercised (but understaffed) team tasked with scrambling to react to crises, the overall picture was dire. \n \nApparently, the then-CTO now CEO Parag Agrawal disagreed on the assessment that Twitter faced a non-negligible existential risk of even brief simultaneous, catastrophic data center failure, and had no workable disaster recovery plan.  Mudge then was instructed to not tell the board about his findings. According to item 52 in the compliant:  \n52. Instructions to withhold information from Board: After the executive team meeting, Mudge was instructed not to send a detailed written report to the Board of Directors, but instead convey his findings orally, at a high level only. Mudge found the request unusual, but as a new team member, complied. With the benefit of hindsight, Mudge now interprets this instruction as an overt act in furtherance of an ongoing effort to restrict critical information and defraud the Board of Directors and Twitter shareholders. \n \nAfter Jack Dorsey stepped down and Parag Agrawal stepped up as CEO, Mudge\u2019s working relationship with Agrawal deteriorated. There\u2019s a lot of redacted sections in the complaint but he was calling something fraudulent and he got terminated a few days after that by Agrawal. \nIn the report, he also called out that Twitter is lying about bots to Elon Musk. He alleged that Twitter CEO is playing word gymnastics and the <5% bot number is based on mDAU (monetizable daily active users), which can be defined internally arbitrarily and is basically a number that\u2019s excluding bots already. According to Mudge, if the number is based on a commonly accepted definition of DAU, Twitter bot percentage would be way higher. We will see how this piece of information would be used in Elon\u2019s Twitter acquisition trial.\u00a0\u00a0 \nThis complaint highlights the challenges site integrity and cybersecurity professionals face when trying to rectify enormous problems large social media platforms have. They are constantly understaffed/under-resourced and are asked to paint a rosy picture even when things are dire. People want to blame the Twitter CEO and its executive team for failing to secure their systems and to fight spams. But I think what we should really blame is the incentive structure. Their performance is measured based on user growth, engagement and revenue. Everyone said security and site integrity is important but the related initiatives are constantly deprioritized across all social media platforms because these efforts are expensive and there\u2019s no clear ROI on growth, engagement or revenue, at least not in the short term. In fact, a system that is exceptional in detecting spam bots might be in conflict with the measurable growth and engagement.  \nWhat ends up happening is that these platforms just want to hire security officers who are willing to sign off whatever terrible stuff they have. I am being super cynical here but I suppose Twitter regretted that it hired someone who actually wanted to do the job and make things better. Just look at what happened at Facebook and see who got fired and who got elevated to the top security/integrity positions. You see the playbook the Big Tech uses. I am against over regulation in general but I believe we need to force these platforms to have a level of transparency so people have a way to know how bad things are and users can decide for themselves how they want to use these platforms.

They are seeing rapid changes in consumers\u2019 spending patterns. During the pandemic, people were buying big ticket items like furniture or large appliances but they stopped doing that. They had to discount deeply to clear their inventory to adapt to these changes. \nJuly 2022\u2019s retail sales report was also released this past Wednesday. The overall retail purchases in July was flat compared to June while the economists expected a 0.1% increase. Excluding gasoline and autos, retail sales rose a better-than-expected 0.7%. (These numbers are not adjusted for inflation.) The retail sales only represent the goods portion of the economy. The service portion, which is not included in this report, is a much bigger part of the overall economy and has been growing fast after the lockdown is over. (Disney park sales are up 70% YoY in Q2 2022.) I believe what we are seeing is that the nominal GDP is still growing fast but real GDP is a different story as the inflation stays at 8+% level. As long as the unemployment rate remains low, I don\u2019t think we are going to see an apocalyptic situation in consumer spending any time soon. But the inflation numbers for the next few months would be critical as it would dictate how high interest rates will go. We haven\u2019t seen the Fed fund rate higher than 6% since 2000. I frankly don\u2019t know what will happen if the rate reaches that level again. All I know is that 2000-2002 was quite a brutal bear market that wiped out a lot of investors.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n"}, {"title": "8/17/2022: My ETH Wallet is Wrongly Sanctioned", "post_id": "69094478.8172022-my-eth-wallet-is-wrongly", "subtitle": "Why are DeFi victims being sanctioned? ", "content": " \nI never thought I would be in this position but I had $300K worth of crypto locked inside AAVE and I couldn\u2019t access it. Apparently, my ETH wallet with an ENS attached to it is being blocked by DeFi protocols such as AAVE and Uniswap related to the Tornado Cash Ban. \nAs a law abiding citizen, this erroneous ban is outrageous. I am a DeFi victim, not a DeFi hacker. As mentioned previously, I am a victim of the Furucombo Attack and lost $200K from the exploit. The Furucombo Hacker transferred ~40K PERP tokens from my address (0x660939b21C0ac3339A98dB9FFBdA74Cd59E07685) with this transaction , swapped all the tokens to ETH and used Tornado Cash to launder the money. I suspect the fact that there\u2019s a direct transfer from my wallet to the hacker\u2019s wallet resulted in the sanction. But that transfer is the hack itself. The sanction algorithm is so dumb that it thinks my wallet should be banned. (There are not that many DeFi hacks. Whoever comes up with the algorithm should be able to do a decent job to know who are the victims and who are the perpetrators.) \nI also checked the US Treasury sanction list related to the Tornado Cash ban. My ETH address is not on the list so the ban on my wallet is derived. I truly hope this can be fixed because this erroneous sanction on my wallet undermines the credibility and gives the naysayers a stronger voice of why the Tornado Cash ban is a mistake. I do believe something needs to be done with all the DeFi hacks but it should also be done right. Having such an obvious false positive is not doing anyone any good.\u00a0 \nInterestingly, in the end I was able to withdraw all my funds from AAVE through direct contract calls as illustrated above. So basically the web UI is blocked but people can still use AAVE by sending transactions to the blockchains directly.  I am not sure how useful blocking the web UI is for sanctioning a wallet.  I believe most hackers are able to make direct contract calls since that\u2019s usually how they carry out the hacks. It is true though that for upgradable proxy contracts , the DeFi protocols will be able to carry out the sanctions at the smart contract level in the future. That\u2019s probably be the direction the authorities would push the DeFi protocols toward.  It would make DeFi safer to use but this direction will also be against the ethos of decentralization and anti-censorship for blockchains. It\u2019s a dilemma the crypto community will grapple with in the coming years.  \nUpdate: someone sent me this link showing me that my address is allowed. (Maybe I was unblocked? But I am still getting javascript errors.)   But this morning, when I was trying to swapped avUSDC to AVAX with 1inch, I got some strange errors and 20+% slippage and I couldn\u2019t connect my wallet with AAVE frontend. I contacted AAVE team through a friend and they told me to withdraw the funds through contract calls directly. They didn\u2019t tell me that my address was allowed.   \nUpdate 2:  I think my address is unblocked. I can connect my wallet with AAVE now.  I am thankful for people who help get the words out so my wallet is finally free.

Without further extension of the suspension, student loan payments are set to start on 9/1/2022. America has a huge student debt problem. According to this Bloomberg article, currently there\u2019s $1.75 trillion of student loans outstanding. About 92% or 1.6 trillion is in the hands of the federal government, which is about 6.5% of US GDP and exceeds credit card loan balances of $890B and auto loan loan balances of $1.5T. This debt problem is very America specific. Around the world in a lot of countries, the college cost is usually quite affordable because educated citizens are the foundation of a great country and most countries would invest in education. I went to National Taiwan University, the top university in Taiwan. As shown below, their tuition currently is about $2000 per year for international students and half of that for local students. In contrast, Yale University\u2019s tuition is $62,250 and it appears that $25K of college tuition per year is considered affordable in the USA. It\u2019s really no surprise why America has a student loan problem.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \nThere has been a lot of talk about loan forgiveness. According to an NPR poll, the general public (55%) supports forgiving up to $10,000 of a person's federal student loan debt. But only 47% of all respondents said they support forgiving up to $50,000 in debt, while 41% expressed support for wiping the slate completely clean for all borrowers. I believe people acknowledge that the student loans are going out of control and something needs to be done. But what does loan forgiveness really mean? At the end of the day, someone has to pay the bill. Loan forgiveness just means that US taxpayers, basically all of us, are footing the bill. \nLoan forgiveness is unfair to financially responsible people who chose not to go to college due to the potentially poor ROI. On the other hand, we make it so easy for 18-year olds to borrow large amounts of money without any payment for years. Should students be fully responsible for this predatory lending? Probably not. I believe colleges need to be more accountable for the student loan mess if any loan forgiveness program is implemented. They charge outrageous tuition and push the students to take out the loans they couldn\u2019t afford all in the name of the good education. This WSJ article told some tragic stories of students getting fancy degrees from top universities like Columbia and NYU with hundreds of thousands dollars in student debt, but their film or publishing degrees didn\u2019t help them get high paying jobs to pay down the debt. I believe the federal student loan program has to raise the underwriting standards and make universities keep a portion of the debt on their balance sheet so when students default, they are also financially affected. Otherwise, they don\u2019t have skin in the game and they would just push their students to take out the loans they couldn\u2019t afford to pay back. \nI believe the loan payment restart might impact consumer spending a little bit. If the interest rate of the $1.75T student debt is 5%, we are talking about $87.5B a year on interest payments. During the loan suspension period, people could spend the $87.5B into the economy and it would have a multiplier effect to generate tens of billions of GDP. If the loan payment restarts, it\u2019s similar to pulling $87.5B of capital out of the economy a year, or $7B+ a month. The current quantitative tightening program is $45B a month so $7B is not insignificant, especially since the money is coming out of student loan borrowers\u2019 pockets.\u00a0 \n \n"}, {"title": "8/16/2022: Housing Starts Fell Sharply in July", "post_id": "68950605.8162022-housing-starts-fell-sharply", "subtitle": "When the Fed increases rates, housing activity slows. ", "content": " \nHousing starts in July fell 9.6% from the month before to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.45 million, which is lower than July 2020\u2019s number of 1.51 million. Building permits declined 1.3% to 1.7 million. The rising interest rates is definitely a big factor in slowing housing starts. The average mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 5.22% last week, according to Freddie Mac. A year before, the rate was under 3%. For a $400K mortgage, the monthly payment for a 30-year mortgage is $1,686 when the rate is 3% but would jump to $2,201 when the rate is 5.22%. That is a 30% increase on monthly mortgage payment. If people can only afford the same monthly payment, the amount they could borrow will dramatically decrease. As illustrated above, a $1,686 monthly payment corresponds to a $400K mortgage when the rate is 3% but only to a $307K mortgage when the rate is 5.22%. \nThe decreased borrowable amount will dramatically impact the house prices. If the mortgage rate goes up to 8%, the borrowable amount would become $230K for the same example mentioned above. I believe this is a very big risk for the housing sector and the overall economy as 50% of the household net worth is tied to real estate and this networth is highly leveraged. It appears that builders are slowing down in building new houses and real estate brokerage Compass also lowered their guidance. It would be interesting to see how this plays out but everything hinges on how high the interest rate will go.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think people have a strong consensus at the moment.\u00a0"}, {"title": "8/15/2022: What is in the Inflation Reduction Act?

Less Deficit ", "content": " \nAfter months of negotiations, a 730-page version of the bill passed the House last Friday and President Biden said he plans to sign it into law. As illustrated above, this bill would raise more taxes from a bunch of low-hanging-fruit areas and make investments in energy security, climate change and health care with a total deficit reduction of $300B+. \nAccording to this CRFB article (which analyzed an earlier version of the bill and gave more details), the drug price reform in the bill will save taxpayers $322 billion in the next decade while making $98B necessary investments in Obama care and vaccines. In terms of new tax revenue, the 15% corporate minimum tax makes a lot of sense. This tax applies to global income of public companies that generate more than $1B of annual profits. Double Irish With a Dutch Sandwich is a well known trick for large corporations to avoid federal income taxes by redirecting revenue to countries where they operate with lower tax rates. But this trick hurt the US Taxpayers. I am glad this is being fixed and can generate $222B of tax revenue in the next decade. Other tax initiatives like investing in IRS enforcement and taxing stock buybacks also makes a lot of sense. Collecting taxes that should have been collected is a no brainer. Stock buybacks are basically a tax avoidance scheme. Notably, the carried interest loophole failed to be closed again!!!. I supposed it failed because it doesn\u2019t generate a lot of revenue ($13B) and one democratic senator strongly objects to it. Failure to close this loophole is more about optics than substance though. In a grand scheme of things, carried interest taxation doesn\u2019t make a huge difference in tax revenue or inequality. In my opinion, closing the step-up basis loophole for estate taxes will be way more impactful in terms of fairness and tax revenue. \nThis document by the Senate summarized the energy security and climate change investments in the inflation reduction act of 2022. It covers a lot of surface area from clean energy technology accelerators to grants to reduce air pollution at ports. According to the doc, the combined investments in the FY2022 Budget Reconciliation bill would put the U.S. on a path to roughly 40% emissions reduction by 2030, and would represent the single biggest climate investment in US history. This document is a must read for people who are interested in investing in climate change and energy security.\u00a0 \n"}, {"title": "8/12/2022: US Treasury Banned Tornado Cash ", "post_id": "68245730.8122022-us-treasury-banned-tornado", "subtitle": " Crypto's Money Laundering Machine Can be Banned but Cannot be Blocked. ", "content": "The Treasury Department has banned all Americans from using decentralized crypto-mixing service Tornado Cash. So what is Tornado Cash exactly? I have a personal story to tell. I was unfortunately a victim of the Furucombo Hack. A hacker was able to transfer tokens from my wallet to theirs by exploiting a vulnerability in  Furucombo\u2019s smart contract, which my wallet interacted with prior to the hack. In a matter of hours, the hacker stole $14M worth of tokens from dozens of victims, swapped all the tokens into ETHs and laundered the ETHs through Tornado Cash. The incident was reported to the FBI but so far nothing has been done and I assumed the funds are gone forever. According to the Treasury department, Tornado Cash has reportedly laundered more than $7 billion worth of cryptos since 2019. \nYou can watch the youtube video above to see how to use Tornado Cash. In summary, you deposit ETH into the Tornado Cash contract and obtain a secret string. You can then redeem the ETH with the secret using another wallet. It\u2019s virtually impossible to link between a sender and a recipient when there are a sufficiently large number of transactions interacting with the Tornado Cash contract. Tornado Cash single handedly enabled the smart contract hack industry and almost every single hack on the EVM ecosystem is using Tornado Cash to launder the hacked funds. According to the Treasury Department, Tornado Cash has been a key tool for the Lazarus Group, a North Korean hacking group tied to the $625 million March hack of Axie Infinity\u2019s Ronin Network. In other words, North Korea  was able to boost their GDP with crypto hacks.  $625M is 3.47% of North Korea\u2019s GDP of $18B in 2019!!!  \nSo how does the Treasury department ban a smart contract exactly? When a smart contract is deployed to the blockchain, it basically runs itself forever on all the blockchain nodes unless the contract deployer puts in some specific mechanism to disable it. As illustrated below, Tornado Cash contract does not have the mechanism to disable deposits/withdrawals as there are only four functions people can call and the changeOperator function no longer works because the operator address was set to zero. To enforce the ban, the Treasury department basically asked all centralized exchanges and stable coin providers like Circle to block all the wallet addresses that have deposited, withdrawn or received funds from Tornado Cash. This means that these sanctioned wallets won\u2019t be able to convert cryptos in their wallets into actual fiat money. Shortly after the announcement, a bunch of wallets that belong to celebrities like Donald Trump or Brian Armstrong started to receive ETH from Tornado Cash and hence are blacklisted. It appears that banning a smart contract is quite complicated. Though that\u2019s precisely the point of decentralization and anti-censorship.\u00a0 \nAccording to a Coin Desk report this morning, the developer for Tornado Cash has been arrested. It\u2019s true that his invention enabled the multi-billion dollar smart contract hack industry. But one can also say there are certain legitimate use cases for sending cryptos around in a privacy preserved way. He created a powerful tool for decentralized money laundering. But if he is not criminally laundering money himself using Tornado Cash, should he be responsible for all the ill-gotten profits other criminals make using his tool? I don\u2019t know. Even if he wants to take down Tornado Cash, he can\u2019t because the smart contract has been deployed and it is immutable. Well, people have argued that the lack of accountability is a feature, not a bug for blockchains. I am very curious to know how the government would respond to this. Now they really know what they have to deal with when the world becomes increasingly decentralized.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"title": "8/11/2022: Disney Had a Great Quarter", "post_id": "68087360.8112022-disney-had-a-great-quarter", "subtitle": "Q2 2022 earnings beat on revenue, EPS and streaming subscriber growth.

It was a bit gut wrenching to do it but I am so glad that I bought the drip. There are a lot of legitimate concerns regarding Disney\u2019s business such as 1) recession and increasing labor costs can hurt parks business, 2) the streaming business is losing billions , 3) new CEO doesn\u2019t seem as good as Bob Iger. But Disney got an incredible moat which is the massive amount of content libraries they built in the past century and the consumer recognition and loyalty. They have to keep up with the times so moving to streaming or changing CEOs makes a lot of sense. I am pretty confident that Disney would still be around in 100 years but I couldn\u2019t say the same for Meta or Visa.

Assuming Vision fund owns 20% of the companies it invested in, it would have to turn $400B of total market cap into $2 trillions. In other words, the market cap of their portfolio  has to grow $1.6 trillion dollars after the investment. To make this work, they basically have to invest in one trillion-dollar company like Google, Apple or Microsoft, Tesla or two 500B+ companies  like Meta, Alibaba or Tencent when they are relatively small.

I am currently traveling and I see so much energy and crowd everywhere I go.  It seems like investors remain cautious about the travel stocks though. Compared to SPY\u2019s 7% drop,  and  are down about 35% YTD, is down 20% YTD.  Investors have been burned by the pandemic stocks and I suppose they are questioning the sustainability of this travel rebound. People did a lot of online shopping during the lockdowns but there\u2019s only so many things people can buy.   I don\u2019t believe people can ever have too many experiences though. It\u2019s great to be out, explore different places and gain first hand knowledge about a place.  Sans another deadly COVID variant, I believe this travel rebound will last longer than investors expected.  \n \n \n \n \n"}, {"title": "8/5/2022: Alibaba's First Revenue Decline", "post_id": "66282309.852022-alibabas-first-revenue-decline", "subtitle": "Crazy COVID zero policy is destroying the Chinese economy. ", "content": " \nAlibaba reported earnings for the quarter ending June 2022 and saw the first ever revenue decline due to the severe COVID lockdowns in China. The past two years have been brutal for Alibaba. BABA 0.00 stock went from $300 in October 2020 to $92 dollars today. The nightmare started when CCP ordered the suspension of IPO for Ant Financial. Then there\u2019s the Jack Ma disappearance, all the \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d push, potential stock delisting from NYSE and then severe COVID lockdowns. \nI never owned any Chinese stocks. It\u2019s probably because I read too much dark history about CCP. I don\u2019t think CCP actually believes in capitalism. (They are the Chinese COMMUNIST party anyway.) I believe they would use capitalism as a tool to accumulate wealth and power and when the time comes, they would get rid of the capitalists and operators that made all the prosperity happen and assume control of big successful businesses. This is exactly what happened. In the past 40 years, more than 850 million Chinese people have been lifted out of extreme poverty after the Chinese economic reform(\u6539\u9769\u958b\u653e). On average, Chinese people\u2019s life is definitely better compared to 40 years ago when China first emerged from the cultural revolution hell. Despite the phenomenal growth, I really don\u2019t know how to be an investor knowing that CCP could one day take over a big well-run company like Alibaba or Tencent. The current Xi Jinping regime seems to be going backwards aggressively with more control and less freedom in all aspects such as asserting control of the Chinese big tech and cracking down on billionaires . The current crazy covid zero policy is literally restricting physical movement of people and bankrupting many individuals and businesses. I honestly don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen if the CCP continue their current trajectory. \nSoftbank is unwinding their stake in Alibaba and Jack Ma plans to cede control of Ant Financial. With the 20th party congress on the horizon, China (and potentially the World) is going through a tumultuous period.

", "content": " \nCongress approves $52 billion funding to aid semiconductor manufacturing. President Biden is expected to sign the bill into law.  More than 65% of the chips are made in Taiwan.  Companies like Apple and Nvidia don\u2019t have their own semiconductor manufacturing facilities. They design the chips and rely on foundries( contract manufacturers) like TSMC to manufacture them. Overtime, the dependency on chip manufacturing in Taiwan grew and currently only ~10% of chips are made in the USA. As the China-USA rivalry intensifies, this Taiwan chip dependency becomes a national security threat. If the foundries in Taiwan grind to a halt due to war or a Chinese takeover, America won\u2019t have the chips to make iPhones, GPUs, SpaceX rockets, ballistic missiles, etc. It makes  a lot of sense to move the manufacturing of  mission critical chips back to the USA.  \nI grew up in Taiwan and majored in Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University. Many of my bright schoolmates in college went to work for TSMC.   I think the $52B funding is good but money isn\u2019t everything. There is not enough semiconductor manufacturing talent in the USA.  Semiconductor manufacturing is very capital intensive and the workers don\u2019t get paid a lot. But to make a semiconductor manufacturing plant work, it\u2019s a big orchestration of the right equipment, right processes and right people. To get the right people in the USA, they need to be paid a lot more and that\u2019s why the manufacturing was moved offshore in the past few decades. Changing the immigrant policy  to allow more foreign talent in semiconductor manufacturing is probably a more effective way to jumpstart chip manufacturing in the USA than free money.  In the long run, the USA has to come up with ways to develop and retain talent in the semiconductor sector to counter threats from China and to stay competitive globally.   \nSpeaker Pelosi is currently visiting Taiwan. China kept threatening her and asked her not to go, saying \"These moves, like playing with fire, are extremely dangerous\". Well, Speaker Pelosi and the Congressional delegation get to go where they want to go.  Since when does China tell American politicians what to do?  Isn\u2019t America the greatest country in the world? To retaliate, China launched a DDos attack on the presidential office website in Taiwan, banned food imports from Taiwan to China and is launching aggressive military exercises opposite Taiwan. I am slightly worried that things could boil over. But as China wants to be No. 1 to sideline America and call the shots on the global stage, the conflict between China and the USA might be inevitable.

In comparison, The SPY returns were 0.55%, 2.22% and 2.28% for May, June and July in 2021 respectively. This crazy volatility is quite typical for the bear market. In the bull market, prices usually go up pretty slowly and steadily. But when things start to get shaky, the market would go down suddenly. Sometimes the market goes down way too much, it then triggers a mad rebound.  \nTo deal with the volatility, my personal approach is to sit tight on my portfolio. Like many people,  I made mistakes during the boom time by taking excessive risks for my portfolio but I have since corrected. I am comfortable with 50% equity exposure in the long run.  \nThe big tech earnings were by and large better than expected based on lowered expectations. Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft all had big relief rallies after the earnings. Meta\u2019s earnings was a little bit worse than expected but its stock price has stabilized. One big takeaway from the earnings is that software is really eating the world. Google and Microsoft both have gigantic software businesses with $200B+ annual revenue. Amazon is not just an e-commerce website for our everyday purchases any more. Amazon made most of its revenue from services like AWS and ads.  Apple\u2019s iPhone is a big business but its service revenue is 19.6B with 70+% gross margin in the most recent quarter.  As big tech\u2019s software businesses further expand, inevitably they are going to battle one another out more brutally on ads, subscriptions and cloud services.

The U.S. economy shrank 0.9%. With the -1.6% GDP growth in Q1 2022, we are now in a recession with two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth.  (The nominal GDP did grow 7.8% though but this number becomes negative after accounting for inflation.)  Despite the numbers meeting the technical definition, both the Treasury Secretary and the Fed Chair think we are not  in a real recession as we have a very strong job market and people still have savings.   \nIf you look at the numbers more closely, consumer spending overall grew 1% with services up 4.1% but goods down -4.5%. This makes a lot of sense as people are shifting their expenses from goods to experiences once the lockdown is over. Private investment activity went down 13.5%!! As illustrated above, there\u2019s quite a dramatic slowdown on \u201cchange in private inventories\u201d, which means businesses slowed down replenishment of inventories. Walmart just issued a profit warning a few days ago about the changing consumer behavior and the inventory pileup in their stores.  Businesses are not adding more inventories before they sell down the current pile. There\u2019s also a -14% change  in \u201cresidential investment\u201d, which is house construction and improvement. With the mortgage rate going up so much,  it\u2019s no surprise that the construction activity is slowing down.  \nIn summary, we are experiencing a service boom but businesses are adjusting to the new consumer behavior and the housing sector is slowing down. With the service sector booming and the labor shortage in that sector, most likely we will continue to have full employment in the near future. That\u2019s why the top government officials think we are not in a real recession once the businesses are adjusting to the new consumer behavior. But my worry is that this could be a supply side recession where the service sector has strong demand but there are not enough healthy workers to fulfill that demand  while people are less interested in buying things due to inflation. Coupled with the slowdown in business spending due to higher interest rates, higher labor cost and inflation, I think there\u2019s still a lot of risk to the economy. I could understand the top government officials are trying to paint a rosy picture as the midterm election is approaching. But let\u2019s call a spade a spade. We are in a recession.  \n \n \n \n"}, {"title": "7/28/2022: A Meta Decline", "post_id": "65987977.7282022-a-meta-decline", "subtitle": "Meta's problems are more than TikTok and Apple privacy changes", "content": " \n reports its first ever revenue drop in Q2 2022.  As mentioned in my previous post,  they are facing many challenges and things are not pretty. Revenue dropped 1%, net income plummeted 36% and the Q3 guidance is abysmal. They are projecting an up to 10% YoY revenue decline for Q3 2022. MAUs and DAUs are pretty flat, which is better than expected. But headcount grew a whopping 32% YoY. Given that revenue is declining, it\u2019s no surprise they are trying to right size the company.  \nFacebook\u2019s biggest challenge is that TikTok is eating their lunch. To counter this threat, they are pivoting their apps to be more TikTok like.  There\u2019s quite a backlash for this but we will see how things turn out in the next few quarters. According to Zuck\u2019s statement, user engagement has increased with this ongoing change. As a Facebook user, I am not too thrilled about this pivot. Seeing dancing videos from strangers is not the reason I go to Facebook.  Interestingly, Zuck didn\u2019t mention the word \u201cTikTok\u201d in his earnings statement. \u201cWhatsApp\u201d was also not mentioned. Does that mean WhatsApp might be spun out to relieve the regulatory pressure? We will see.   \nThere\u2019s also the Apple privacy change.  But I believe the revenue has been reset to reflect the impact of this change. Sure there can still be some incremental impact down the road but the magnitude is going to be smaller and it is probably going to be countered by the various improvements Facebook make.  \nIn my opinion, the biggest elephant in the room is this metaverse pivot. Apparently, Zuck is betting the whole company on metaverse.  This is quite shocking to me and the reason why I sold all my $FB before it became $META. This bet is extremely risky. It's not really built on Facebook's core competency, which imo is the connected graph and fast iterative data driven development cycle.   Facebook is a growth company, not a platform company.  They even coined the term \u201cGrowth Hacking\u201d.  This is quite a different mindset from building hardware and logistics.  Plus, how can he be so confident that metaverse has a trillion dollar future and Facebook would own it? Nobody can predict the future so precisely.  They are a 500B company and they are betting their future on one thing that is basically pre-product market fit(???!!!).  This boggles my mind.  \nIn contrast, to stay relevant, Alphabet placed many bets and hoped some of them would work out in the long run. That strategy makes way more sense to me.  They had a few successful bets with this strategy: G-suite, Waymo, Android.  They did have a bunch of flops too like Google Glass, Google Loom , Google Fiber, etc. But failure of a bet is never going to jeopardize the company.  On the other hand, Zuck is driving the company to a binary outcome. If metaverse doesn\u2019t materialize as expected, Facebook would be in a very difficult position.  \nFinally, they announced the transition of CFO. In less than a year, Meta\u2019s COO, CFO and CTO are all stepping down.  I worked at Facebook from 2006-2011 so I know these people\u2019s backgrounds.  Instead of adding some fresh flood, Zuck is replacing old-timers with older-timers. With these changes, he is making his tight inner circle even tighter. AFAIK, all the newly appointed executives are super smart and capable people and have been with the company for 14+ years. But all three had less than 5 years of full-time working experience before Facebook. In contrast, Sheryl, Schrep and Dave  were already very well accomplished seasoned executives prior to Facebook. In short, Zuck is creating an even stronger echo chamber with these executive transitions. I suppose this is necessary for his metaverse bet but I suspect the final outcome is either going to be very very very good  or very very very bad.

", "content": " \nAs expected, Fed raises interest rates by 75 basis points after today\u2019s FOMC meeting. This will lift the benchmark federal-funds rate to a range between 2.25% and 2.5%. The rate increase won unanimous backing from the 12-member rate-setting committee.  I feel it\u2019s appropriate to paste the entire policy statement from the Fed officials here as it\u2019s quite informative on which directions they are going.  \n\u201cRecent indicators of spending and production have softened. Nonetheless, job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures. \nRussia's war against Ukraine is causing tremendous human and economic hardship. The war and related events are creating additional upward pressure on inflation and are weighing on global economic activity. The Committee is highly attentive to inflation risks. \nThe Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet that were issued in May. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.\u201d \nWe all know that Fed is very concerned about inflation and plans to raise rates higher to contain inflation. Though among the investment community, there\u2019s already talk that Fed is going to raise the rates to ~3% by the end of this year and then starts cutting rates next year, according to this WSJ article.  The treasury yields are currently progressively lower moving from one-year bills to 10-year notes as illustrated above.  This inverted yield curve is usually indicative of a recession.  The hope is that through the rapid rate increases, the Fed would quickly induce a recession to tame the inflation and they can start cutting the rates back once the inflation is under control. From the same WSJ article, the projection is that the rate would be cut to 2.5% level in June 2024 (instead of 0%). Chances are the 0% interest rate environment would be gone for a while until the inflation pressure is no longer a concern.  \nOverall, I feel it\u2019s kind of bold for people to predict rate cuts in 2023 right now.  There are so many known unknowns such as new COVID variants, the 20th Party Congress in China, the winter gas supply from Russia to Europe, etc. Not to mention there are also unknown unknowns.  Around the same time last year,  one of the Fed officials said they probably  would start raising rates in early 2023.  Given where we are right now, I will take these predictions with a grain of salt.  I am definitely not making any hasty investment decisions based on these predictions.  \n"}, {"title": "7/26/2022: Are We Seeing a Business Spending Slowdown?

Alphabet slightly beat on ad revenue but missed on overall revenue and EPS. Microsoft missed both revenue and EPS. This is somewhat expected. After the disastrous  earnings last week, people are prepared for the worst. Google ad revenue turned out to be alright. But cloud revenue for both Google and Microsoft was lower than expected. Chances are businesses becoming more conservative on their IT spending. In an uncertain environment, that\u2019s one of the easiest areas to find savings or scale back on spending.  This might be indicative of a trend for many SaaS companies. After years of increased spending on cloud and SaaS services, companies might choose not to upgrade or even cut underutilized services under this uncertain environment.  This downtown would be informative on which services hold the staying power and could succeed in the long run.  \n \nBack to ad spending, Google search ads is less impacted by the infamous Apple privacy change since the ads are mostly targeted by the search queries.  Search ads grew a healthy clip of 13.5% (from $35.9B to $40.7B) although it\u2019s quite a deceleration from the 24.3% growth in Q1, indicating a potential slowdown of marketing spending from businesses.  YouTube revenue only grew 4.8%, a dramatic slowdown from the growth of 14.4% in Q1 2022, which probably could be partially attributed to the Apple Privacy change introduced at the end of Q2 2021. The Apple privacy change makes micro-targeting on users less effective.  Unlike search ads, social media platforms like Snap, Facebook and Youtube rely primarily on these micro-targeted ads for their revenue. In other words, it used to be that when an ad was shown, out of one million ad views, there might be on-average 5 conversions like app downloads, account signups or online purchases happening. After the Apple privacy change was implemented, that number went from 5 to 2 (not actual numbers just an example). It\u2019s either that the advertiser has to pay more per conversion or the advertising platform has to reduce the ad price per ad view to make this work.  It would eventually land on an equilibrium where advertisers pay a bit more per conversion and advertising platforms earn a bit less per ad view.  From this YouTube number and the SNAP numbers (users grew 18% but revenue only grew 13%), I truly worry about Facebook\u2019s numbers tomorrow.  On the other hand, the expectation for Facebook\u2019s earnings is already set so low. Not-so-horrible would be considered good. "}, {"title": "7/25/2022: What Happened to Sri Lanka?

Its president fled the country amid the economic crisis  Inflation touched a year-on-year record of 54.6% in June while the Sri Lanka rupee exchange rate has fallen more than 40% since the end of February. They don\u2019t even have enough money in their foreign reserve to buy fuel. The country is grinding to a halt and riots are erupting. How does a country with such rich natural resources  on a strategic location in the Indian Ocean get to this point?  \nThis article gives a pretty good overview on what happened to Sri Lanka.  In summary, the country was already in trouble even before COVID. Their debt grew from $11.3B in 2005 to $50.72B in 2021 while their gross GDP only grew from $24.4B in 2005 to $80.7B in 2020. They borrowed money for various infrastructure projects that didn\u2019t quite pay off. They owe $10B to China alone and two big infrastructure projects are already under China\u2019s control because Sri Lanka defaulted on the loans.   The fleeing president Rajapaksa\u2019s family has been in control of the Sri Lanka government since 2005 and they obviously didn\u2019t take the country into the right direction. The government  debt skyrocketed. They also banned chemical fertilizers  which decreased the agricultural output and made the price of staples like rice go up. This excessive borrowing for unsuccessful infrastructural projects and decreased agricultural output set them up for the perfect storm.  To make things worse, the government decided to do a tax cut in 2021, further emptying the government coffer.  \nSri Lanka is a net importer and runs on a trade deficit.  Tourism has been a big source of foreign reserve for Sri Lanka and 12% of their GDP. Tourism and worker remittance are the main sources to maintain their foreign currency reserve and to keep their exchange rate steady. But in 2019, a terrorist attack that killed 269 and injured 500+ people deeply affected the tourism industry and the COVID pandemic practically stopped the tourists from arriving until late 2021. The demand for the Sri Lanka Rupees collapsed and their foreign currency reserve runs really low, not even enough to pay for the fuel shipments.  But it\u2019s hard for them to borrow more money because they already have too much debt and are already defaulting on the interest payments.  They would need some kind of bailout to get out of this hole. India is reluctantly doing it as Sri Lanka is in a strategically important location and they don\u2019t want China to take over the country.  \nIf we think of Sri Lanka as a corporation and its currency as its stock, I believe it\u2019s quite straightforward to understand how they get to this point. Sri Lanka was a small-cap company with okay finances to begin with.  But they hired a bad CEO(President) who made a series of terrible decisions including excessive borrowing, hiring his family members as company executives, big and unsuccessful investments (infrastructure projects), nonsensical price cuts on their product (tax cuts) and cash flow reduction in the name of doing good (chemical fertilizer ban). Coupled with external factors such as COVID and terrorist attacks that torpedoed its revenue sources, the company is now bankrupt. The CEO was forced out. But most likely, he left with millions of dollars (corruption) while shareholders (Sri Lankans) are left with a crashing stock price and little hope to get back to normal.

They saw the largest quarterly decline in VC performance ever observed in their dataset. \nAngelList is the largest early stage funding platform of the world. The report is based on the 8,306 seasoned startup investments on the platform entering into Q2 2022. As you may know, startup investments take a very long time (5-10+ years) to become liquid, a proxy metric people often use to measure the performance of a startup portfolio is the followup funding rate: the percentage of startups that raise additional funding or take an exit after the previous funding has seasoned (typically after 12-18 months).  \nAccording to the report, the followup  funding rate was 9.3% for Q2 2022  vs. 11.6% for Q1 2022, a 20% decline. Among the startups that received followup funding , 77.5% was positive, meaning the startup saw its share price increase in Q2 2022 vs. 83% in Q1, a 7% decline which marks the second largest quarterly drop in positive activity rate ever (after Q2 2020).  In other words, the  markup rate, percentage of startups that received followup funding at a higher valuation, is 9.3*0.775 = 7.21% in Q2 2022 vs. 11.6*0.83 = 9.63%, a 25% decline QoQ.   \nInterestingly, the valuation itself doesn\u2019t move much. Average pre-seed valuations jumped 17% in 2Q22 to $12.6M. Seed-stage valuations declined by a modest 3% to $33.3M, and Series A valuations declined by an even more modest 0.4% to $99.5M.  I am a bit shocked that the pre-seed valuation actually went up and the seed/series A valuation remained so high.   \n \nIf  we reference at the previous report in 2021, the median valuation  $8M, $15M, $60M for pre-seed, seed, series A respectively in 2021 and $10M, $20M, $70M in Q2 2022. After a super frothy 2021 and a 50+% fall on tech stocks in early 2022, I couldn\u2019t believe we are still seeing a modest increase in startup valuation. The activity rate decline does indicate that investors are getting cautious. We might eventually see a valuation decline but it would probably take another quarter or two for the data to show as it takes time for founders to raise and close a funding round.  \n I believe we are in a transitory period of startup investments. We are moving back to the more normal time of 2019 where founders need to put in more work for fundraising and investors can do deeper due diligence before making decisions. This is actually a very healthy development. Running a startup is extremely hard and risky. During fundraising,  it\u2019s usually a great time for founders to reflect on what they really want from business and life.  I am afraid that in 2021, easy money deprived some founders of going through this soul searching process and many founders got into venture-backed startups for the wrong reasons.  In tougher times, resourceful founders who can execute would still make it work. But most trendy startups with high burn and a weak business model are probably going to go out of business. This consolidation is healthy and hopefully we will see some great companies built coming out of this market crash.  \n \n"}, {"title": "7/21/2022: Tesla Revenue Dropped in Q2", "post_id": "64934471.7212022-tesla-revenue-drops-in-q2", "subtitle": "Tesla couldn't produce vehicles fast enough to meet demand", "content": " \nTesla reported its first sequential decline in quarterly revenue since Q1 2021.

Maybe I am old school but I simply don\u2019t understand how they can maintain this valuation for the long run. They need to triple their profits to bring their P/E below 30. Let\u2019s assume they could maintain good pricing power.  They will probably still need to scale up their production at least 2X, which is a lot of capital expenditures. We also don\u2019t know if the current auto boom would continue. There\u2019s a potential risk that the future demand doesn\u2019t meet the extra capacity they are building.

If we just deduct all the content investment as spending (-$4.68B)  and add back the content amortization (+$3.26B), the difference (-$1.42B) is pretty much their net income. In other words, they are not really making much money.  Hopefully, they can reduce the ratio to one and have billions of cash flow per year. But before that,  I don\u2019t think   is a stock I would own.  \n \nNetflix also mentioned that they are going to add a cheaper ad tier and paid sharing to super charge their subscriber growth.  Apparently,  they are running out of low-hanging growth opportunities that they have to resort to running ads and clamping down on account sharing.  I suppose this growth chasing is the inevitable fate for all high growth public companies, which I found quite depressing.  Netflix is a good product. I am a subscriber. I hope their product and user experience stay good after all these changes.

According to FactSet data, 1073 companies IPO\u2019d in 2021, raising $317 billion; in the first half of 2022, the total was just 92 companies, raising just under $9 billion. Well, if you look at the graph above, 2020 and 2021 look more like anomalies than the norm. After two overheated IPO years, it\u2019s time for things to cool down a little bit. If the second half of 2022 follows the current trend, the number of IPOs will be down ~80% from 2021 but only ~25% down  from 2019.  \nThe 2021 IPO class also performed quite poorly with respect to the indexes. According to this Bloomberg Article  dated Dec 22, 2021, on a weighted average basis, the IPO class of 2021 is up only about 1.6%. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 indexes have returned 19% and 24% respectively in 2021 despite a major selloff in December. I just pulled out the performance YTD (1/1/2022-7/18/2022) of the top 10 IPOs in 2021 ranked by deal size. As shown in the graph below the returns have been abysmal YTD after a low performance in 2021. Of the top 10 IPOs, only Bumble (  ) outperforms   or  YTD but it\u2019s still down 50% from the IPO day close. The other 9 companies are down from 40% to 73% YTD!!  Cryptos and SPACS are comparably bad in terms of investment returns YTD. In other words, the hottest sectors of 2021: IPOs, Cryptos and SPACS are among the worst performers in 2022. In retrospect, it\u2019s not too surprising. But it doesn\u2019t appear that the majority of investors took their profits in 2021.  \n \nThe interesting thing here is how people get caught up in the mania over and over again. Last year the stock group I am in was filled with discussions about   ,  ,  , etc. People were so optimistic that they forgot that hyper growth is hard to sustain and valuations do matter.  I considered myself pretty good at avoiding FOMO. But I still bought into  when it fell from its IPO highs.  Theoretically, I know I should avoid hot sectors because they mostly turn cold a year or so later. But practically, I made the mistakes I precisely wanted to avoid. Now the pendulum has swung the other way. I am not so confident I can do the theoretical \u201cBe greedy when other people are fearful\u201d thing.  I am probably going to do the exact opposite.

As of July 13, 2022 it owed more than $4.7B of user deposits with only $4.3B of total assets and $5.5B of total liabilities. No, 3AC didn\u2019t bankrupt them. Their claim to 3AC is only $40.6 millions according to the filing but they have a total of $1.2B shortfall. With the $800M+ venture funding, they somehow vaporized $2B in a couple of years. I found it quite atrocious that Celsius called itself a bank but has no loss reserves and no equity.    \nCelsius marketed itself as a tech forward banking platform that is revolutionizing the world of finance with a charismatic CEO, fancy web3 capabilities, $800M+ of venture funding, and most importantly high interest rates on user deposits. They claimed that their main business model is to loan crypto to institutions. Unlike big banks who mostly pocket the profits of lending themselves while paying users crumbs, Celsius shared 80% of the profits with users. When the crypto gravy train was chugging along, they seemed to be on top of the world. But nobody actually knew what happened to all the money they took from the users as they are not required to disclose what\u2019s going on. They just shouted \u201cTrust me!\u201d. Shockingly, a good number of people actually did trust them and are being burned badly. People now realize why banking regulations exist. Charlatans take advantage of opportunities like this to enrich themselves and impoverish the public. Well, sometimes they don\u2019t even enrich themselves. They just take excessive risk of the user deposits and lose it all. You can watch the video below to get a good glimpse on how Celsius got influencers to shill their platform. Knowing what we know now, their marketing is disgusting.\u00a0 \n \nUnfortunately, I am actually guilty myself. I am a tiny equity investor of BlockFi. I invested in BlockFi in mid-2020 while they were growing like weeds. My thought was that I wouldn\u2019t put money on BlockFi as a user because they are not FDIC insured. However, if the company could keep growing, investing in BlockFi equity would be a good leveraged bet. BlockFi\u2019s marketing is less aggressive than Celsius but it\u2019s basically the same thing. My investment is set to be wiped out. But money aside, I regretted participating in the deal.\u00a0 I do think BlockFi has better intentions but I don\u2019t believe their business model would work once the platform is subject to necessary regulations. \nFinally, I believe Crypto CeFi is worse than both DeFi and TradFi. On DeFi, at least all the data is out in the open on the blockchain. It\u2019s super transparent. You can inspect the blockchain data to determine if the risk is worth it. People have been pointing out Terra/Luna\u2019s vulnerabilities months before its collapse. People could see the problem because Anchor protocol\u2019s enormous UST balance is shown prominently on the website. On DeFi lending platforms like Aave or Compound, you know exactly how much liquidity is out there, which wallet is at risk of getting liquidated and how the borrowing/lending rates are calculated. All the data is there and the assumption is that users take full responsibility when they interact with these DeFi platforms. In TradFi (aka regulated banks), banks have to spend considerable effort to manage risks, meet capital adequacy requirements and report their data to regulators on a regular basis. With that, our deposit in banks is FDIC-insured up to $250K. Unregulated crypto CeFi lacks both transparency and regulatory oversight. People should not be surprised why they blew up.

The Chinese government quickly censored crowd-sourced documents tallying the number of mortgage boycotts spreading across the country to stem the contagion. Fortunately, some of these documents are put on github and they are still available. As of now, more than 300 home development projects have received letter from buyers to request a  \u201cMortgage Suspension\u201d  (\u505c\u8cb8) until the developers make significant progress on the construction.  \nApparently in China, it\u2019s very common for home buyers to pay for a house before it\u2019s built.  When a  home buyer signs the contract to buy a home that\u2019s yet to be built, they would make a downpayment and get a mortgage from the bank. These funds would be placed into an escrow account. The developer could use the funds for construction and the buyer would start making mortgage payments to the bank. The developer is supposed to follow the timeline specified in the contract to deliver the home to the buyer on time.  After going through a bunch of these notices on the github, I believe the home buyers\u2019 demand is in general quite reasonable.  In essence,  developers have used up most of the escrowed funds while making little progress on the construction. In some cases, the project completion deadline is already past but the homes are far from being completed. Banks were supposed to make sure that developers are using the funds properly but buyers alleged otherwise since the houses are not built but the money is already gone . If I were a home buyer in such a situation, I would boycott the mortgage too.  \nAccording to this WSJ article,  many Chinese real estate developers\u2019 bonds are trading at distressed levels of  less than $0.5 on the dollar. The big offender Evergrande\u2019s June 2025 bond issue is currently trading at ~$0.09 on the dollar!!!  Somehow after receiving so much mortgage money from the banks and borrowing even more from foreign investors, these developers have no money to finish up the homes. \nIn addition,  macroeconomic head winds are blowing super hard on the real estate sector. China\u2019s Q2 GDP  only grew 0.4%, the slowest since the Wuhan lockdown. Because of the zero-covid policy, people are reluctant to invest in the future. The home sales have tumbled. New home sales from the top 100 developers were down 59.4% and 42.8%  YoY this May and June respectively. Home prices are also dropping for the 10th consecutive month. If I were a potential home buyer in China, I would be scared to buy a new home right now.  What if my city gets locked down again and I lose my income? What if the home prices keep going down?  What if the developer takes the money but doesn\u2019t finish the home?  These concerns can also feed on one another to form a downward spiral.  \nNomura estimates that Chinese developers have only delivered around 60% of homes they presold between 2013 and 2020. Developers need to figure out a solution to deliver the homes so buyers\u2019 confidence can be restored. China is the second largest economy in the world and real estate is 25-30% of China\u2019s economy.  I can\u2019t imagine what will happen if China\u2019s real estate market collapses. There would be a lot of innocent lives ruined if the home buyers are asked to hold the bag of unfinished homes."}, {"title": "7/14/2022: Consumer Spending is Still Robust ", "post_id": "64084582.7142022-consumers-spending-is-still", "subtitle": "$JPM's earning report shed light on the current state of US economy", "content": "JP Morgan Chase just issued their Q2 2022 earning report this morning.

Auto loan and lease originations are down 44%. But spending on Chase credit cards rose 21% from a year ago and 15% from the first quarter. Chase customers also started carrying more credit card debt, with card loans up 17% from a year ago.  \nChase\u2019s customers tend to be more affluent so these data points might not be fully representative but it still provides good insights on current consumer behavior. Basically, except for big ticket items, consumers are actually spending more despite all the recession/inflation narrative.  This corresponds to my personal experience of  increased spending on experiences like dining and travel after the omicron wave.  It would be interesting to see if this increased spending would slow down after this hot summer travel season. My hunch is people would continue to spend on experiences if they could afford it. But this would also mean the supply side constraint will continue and inflation will be here to stay.  \nJamie Dimon, JP Morgan Chase\u2019 CEO, also made the following comment in the earnings release: \u201cThe U.S. economy continues to grow and both the job market and consumer spending, and their ability to spend, remain healthy. \u2026 But geopolitical tension, high inflation, waning consumer confidence, the uncertainty about how high rates have to go and the never-before-seen quantitative tightening and their effects on global liquidity, combined with the war in Ukraine and its harmful effect on global energy and food prices are very likely to have negative consequences on the global economy sometime down the road. \u201d In summary, things look pretty good right now but the outlook is quite worrisome.  \nWith this report, chances are Q2\u2019s GDP would not turn out to be negative like Q1\u2019s.

The labor market has been tight. Now prices are getting higher across the board, workers would demand higher wages or switch to higher paying jobs to pay their bills. Businesses would have to raise the prices to reflect the increased labor and other costs. This price hiking would keep going until an equilibrium is reached.

We know he is an against-the-grain kind of person but I think this time he simply took it too far. I suppose this outcome is still slightly better than him actually buying twitter though.  His Tesla and SpaceX stocks could have been liquidated if he got a margin call for the loans he used to purchase Twitter if the market keeps tanking.  Money aside, Twitter is  a big hot potato. The Twitter purchase would have caused him an extreme amount of agony.  Sure he likes Twitter a lot and he is a super active user with many followers. He is also so rich that if he really wants, he could really afford the $44B price tag. But the fact he could doesn\u2019t mean he should. He shouldn\u2019t have got involved in the first place.

Even if Bret Taylor (The Twitter board chair) and other directors on the board did not want to pursue damage personally, they have to do that for the shareholders.

But then it created a vacuum when the restaurants reopened.   \nFurthermore, as mentioned in the previous post, we now have a sicker population due to COVID-19.  The services jobs typically have very high covid risk as these jobs require many human interactions.  It\u2019s entirely likely many of the service workers ended up being too sick to work or having to be a caretaker of their sick family members.  I would also imagine most of the stimulus money, crypto money, play the market money already ran out. My guess is that people are already back to work but we only have so many healthy workers available. We will have to live with this until the population get more healthy.

Well, the bear market has humbled me and grounded me. If success is a lousy teacher, failure teaches great lessons. Here is the story of me buying the dip and the dip dipping more deeply.\u00a0 \nI have always been a fairly conservative investor. My liquid portfolio is 60/40 index funds, Facebook stock and cash. In 2021, I decided to aggressively diversify from FB holdings.\u00a0After selling, I wanted to put the proceeds for growth opportunities (because that was what people did in 2021). At first, I bought some biotech stocks. I am very bullish on biotech stocks in the long run. I thought I bought them at relatively low prices:    at $70 (ATH $110) and    at $20 (ATH $35). They have been down 60% and 75% respectively since I bought them in 2021. I closed the positions of PACB at 50% loss but kept SDGR. I forgot that stocks of solid companies could go down 80% if the valuation wasn\u2019t right.\u00a0 \nIn December 2021, I bought   at $35 and thought they are positioned to dominate the higher education market in the long run. But after I bought the stock,\u00a0 it dawned on me that I didn't need to get involved in every good opportunity out there.\u00a0 I am a busy person. Buying and researching small cap stocks was not a good use of my time. I sold COUR at cost. It turns out I dodged a major bullet. COUR is now hovering around $15. I still believe in the company in the long run but again, I don\u2019t think I should get involved in small caps.\u00a0 \nInterestingly, I made the same mistake again in March 2022 buying  . I thought PINS was very undervalued, falling from $80 to $20 with Enterprise Value/Revenue around 4.\u00a0 Because of the Apple privacy change, I believe some of the Facebook ad budget would be shifted to smaller players like PINS. I bought the stock at $22. I realized my mistake almost immediately after the purchase. (I promised myself not to buy individual small cap stocks when I sold COUR.) \u00a0 Luckily, I was able to sell  PINS at around $25. In the meantime, I realized that I have a behavioral problem.\u00a0 I needed to resist the urge to buy the dip. I hypothesized that perhaps I had too much cash in my brokerage account. My rational brain told me to keep the cash but my impulsive brain wanted to buy the dip.\u00a0 I moved the cash to a different account and\u00a0 thank god I have since not done any dip buying.\u00a0 \nFinally, my biggest mistake is selling puts on   and   when they crashed. I have always been a fan of the Zoom and Docusign products. When ZM was around $140, I thought the price had become reasonable. I sold puts at $120 strike and thought if the price dipped below, I would own the stock. ZM of course crashed further but luckily I closed the option position when the stock rebounded at a slight loss. Same thing happened for DOCU. I sold the puts at $100 strike while it\u2019s around $115. This time I was not so lucky. It went all the way down to $60 and I closed the option position at a steep loss. It turned out I didn\u2019t have a super high conviction for ZM and DOCU. Their SaaS businesses are probably going to be hurt during the recession as businesses are cutting back their spending and avoiding contract upgrades. High growth companies also over bloated during the good times. I still think they are going to be great companies in the long run but they have a few difficult years ahead.\u00a0 \nI believe what happened to me is what happened to most retail investors in the current bear market: I am not mentally strong enough to hold onto individual stocks with calm when they go down more than 50%. The overall lesson is that I should have stuck to index funds/cash and chilled. I plan to sit tight on the cash pile\u00a0 and buy some index funds when SPY dips below 320. If SPY does not dip below 320, I will hold onto the cash as my liquid portfolio is already 50% equity. This market crash is too scary.

It worked like magic until the clock stroke midnight and the magic stopped.   \nIt appeared that when crypto prices started crashing after the UST/LUNA collapse, 3AC doubled down on their strategy (instead of cutting their losses), borrowed as much money as they could and bought the dip.

But according to this Quartz article,  there is evidence that Long covid is shrinking the British workforce. There is less immigration due to COVID and there was also a marked drop in labor participation rates, especially among people aged 50 to 64:  most of which was due to long-term sickness. Furthermore,  I don\u2019t think data we have so far account for people who temporarily lose their cognitive functions due to COVID.  People could be back to the work but they are not performing at the same level like they used to be.  \nThe current economic data is probably telling us that our population are still quite sick with COVID-19. Among all the problems we have,  public health is probably the most important one to address before we even think about inflation or recession.  \n  \nThanks for reading The Great Reset Diary 2022- !

", "content": "When bitcoins were at $50K/BTC, crypto investors look like visionaries and innovators.  But now after crashing 60-90% YTD, the same investors look stupid and greedy.  I believe decentralization could enable some game changing applications but the amount of grift and leverage in crypto is astounding. A reset is ultimately healthy.   \nImagine you are a professional in Russia, Argentina, Ukraine  or any country where the government or banking system is or could become shaky. Where would you park your money?  I would 100% convert some of my money into USDC or DAI and put it on chain. I would be able to access this decentralized money  no matter where my physical location is as long as I have my private key. This wouldn\u2019t be the case if I have money in a Russian bank while traveling abroad after the Ukrainian war breaks. In other words, decentralized money give people a good amount power and control over their financial assets even if their government or currencies are in shambles. This is probably not a super important feature for people who live in stable places like America. But if I am a citizen in an unbanked developing country, decentralized money on blockchain could be a total game changer for me.  So I think the decentralized money could be very useful.  \nOn the other hand, I don\u2019t think you can decentralize everything.  The trilemma of  decentralization, scalability and security for blockchain applications is real. You can only pick two out of the three. In other words, you need to pick between decentralization and scalability because security is a given. Are there many important applications out there that decentralization trumps scalability? That\u2019s the question we need to ask as investors. In the mean time, 90+% of the crypto projects out there are just toy or grifty self-referencing applications that would get washed out in this great reset. I wouldn\u2019t touch all these s**t coins.  But I look forward to game changing decentralization applications in the upcoming years.

Well, I think part of the reason is that stocks were doing too great in 2020 and 2021. It\u2019s due for a big correction and the loose money policy is backfiring. It\u2019s hard to say what would happen in H2 2022. My prediction is that we need to go down another 20+%. SPY at 320 would be an entry point for me, which is the SPY price on 1/1/2020.  \nMy previous employer Facebook, currently known as Meta sent an internal memo noting tough times ahead with super strong head winds. I knew they are in trouble. Huge headwinds include \nDeteriorating economy that would impact ad spending \nApple Privacy Change. (Google is implementing the privacy change too.) \nTik Tok \nPeople  spending less time online post pandemic \nLow employee morale \nQuestionable Metaverse investment \n \n I sold all my   stock before it became   (I keep a tiny amount to donate to my DAF but I don\u2019t consider that my money)  so I don\u2019t have a financial interest in them any more.  But I do wonder if they are going to be the next AOL or Sun Microsystems. People are gradually leaving the platforms and they do a really bad job being a steward of the giant platforms they are in control of. People got locked out of their accounts and couldn\u2019t get them back or got put into Facebook jail erroneously in an alarming rate. It\u2019s not going to end well. I predict META would fall into  obscurity in the next decade.  The lack of care for users is catching up with them.

But most likely we are in a new era, an era with modest investment returns.  I was debating if I should stay invested in the formerly highly valued SaaS companies like DOCU. In fact, I sold some puts that are under water. I decided to take the losses, closed the open positions and start anew.  \nIn the past decade, both companies and consumers are spending like crazy. This overspending trend culminated in 2021, coupled with other factors resulting in runaway inflation. People overbought things they don\u2019t need and businesses in the professional sectors over hired. People invested all their cash into stocks, real estate and cryptos, sometimes with borrowed money.  We are finally at the moment of a rude awakening.  Individuals and businesses are cutting back on their spending on both consumption and investments. I think this is healthy in the long run but it\u2019s hard to predict how long this consolidation will take.  By nature we would likely see a recession while the cutback is happening.  \nIn the mean time, I decide to take losses and cash out the positions that\u2019s high risk: i.e. DOCU and ZM. I am sure these strong companies are going to last thru this slowdown and come out stronger. But it would take them some time to digest thru years of overspending on sales, marketing and R&D to get back on the right track. Personally, I also want to have a stronger balance sheet that could take another 50+%  stock market fall with ease. I am currently 50% cash and 50% equity with no debt.   \nI am saddened to read about people contemplating suicide because of large financial losses. I know psychologically it\u2019s really hard for people to part ways with losing bets. But learning to admit mistakes, taking losses and managing risk is an important skill for any investor. At the end of the day, it\u2019s just money.  Money is a tool to make our life better. It\u2019s a means to the end, not the end itself.  If you are depressed or anxious about your portfolio, I have two suggestions:   \nIf you have a complex portfolio with derivatives, concentrated positions or margin debt, I would suggest you to close the positions first and to start anew. Don\u2019t dwell on past mistakes or try to do mental accounting on how much you have to earn back to break even. Many people inadvertently become gamblers by betting bigger trying to break even. Don\u2019t fall into that trap.  Always look forward and be objective.  \nIf you have a well diversified portfolio and you don\u2019t need to sell to fund major purchases, I would suggest to log out your brokerage account and not look at it for the next 5-10 years. Most likely your portfolio would be fine and  you are probably getting some dividends along the way. Again, it\u2019s just money. It\u2019s a tool. If you don\u2019t desperately need that tool for a while, no need to stress about it.  \n"}, {"title": "6/28/22: Are People Back in Office Yet?", "post_id": "61600193.62822-are-people-back-in-office-yet", "subtitle": "I don't see a lot of people.

Well, Mr. Market is not predictable and we have to learn to live with this crazy volatility. I am so glad I don\u2019t have margin debt and I am able to live off the dividends (for now).  \n \nI went to check out some office space at  Spaces, Menlo Park. It\u2019s a very nice building. But there are really not a lot of people there. Interestingly, most of the lower priced  (<$5000/mo) offices are leased out. We are looking for spaces for 6-8 people and they have one office barely available for that size under our $6000/mo budget. They do have many bigger suites that\u2019s asking for $10K+/mo available. But there doesn\u2019t seem to be many takers.   I do hope they stay in business. I believe nice office space makes people more productive.

A lot of hedge funds are shorting it and I think they are going to make a good profit from it.  \nIMO, USDT is pretty much toast. It's just a time bomb waiting to explode. They have 15% of risk assets (corp bonds, digital currency...) at the end of Q1 2022 and 30% commercial paper that's subject to currency risk. (USD went up ~8% since end of Q1). If we are being charitable and assume the risk assets went down only 20% and commercial paper went down 5% and the other reserves keep their value at 100%, they would be down around 5% for the asset base. That\u2019s when they had 82B of market cap (with a very small buffer/equity of $163M), 15B has been redeemed at this point. If we do the math 82B*0.95-15B = ~63B. They have around ~4B shortfall right now assuming their attestation was accurate. Most likely, their shortfall is way bigger. If the redemption continues, that 4B would become a larger and larger percentage.  I couldn\u2019t imagine what their attestation of Q2E 2022 will look like. But we shall see in the next few months.  \nIf I were a hedge fund, I will short USDT, buy USDT at $0.999 and redeem. As long as my outstanding shorts are bigger than my USDT holdings, I am in the money. Once I got the redemption, I will keep buying and redeeming until USDT blows up. If USDT tried to repay in a BS way like over many installments. I will make a big noise on media and that would trigger more redemptions.  I am sure many hedge funds are doing that. Let\u2019s wait for big whales like Ken Griffin to do it and take USDT down and finally crypto would be in a healthier place to invest."}, {"title": "Prologue: Are We Heading into a Huge Recession?
